From Document 1, Section 5.9, it is mentioned that a party may assign its rights and obligations under the Agreement to its Affiliate or subsidiaries with the prior written consent of the other party. However, this provision seems to be about assignment, not transfer of the license to a third party.

From Document 2, Section (h) Assignment, it is stated that neither party may assign its rights, duties, or obligations under this Agreement to any third party in whole or in part, without the other party's prior written consent, except in certain circumstances.

Document 1: Section (a) provides that a party's liability is capped for certain types of breaches, but it does not explicitly state that liability is uncapped for the breach of a party's obligation.

This implies that NETGEAR may have some form of compensation or cancellation of unfulfilled orders when the Distributor breaches the contract. However, this does not necessarily mean a termination fee.

Document 2 (Section 7.2) states that during the contract, a party is restricted from soliciting, enticing, or inducing any Customer of the counterparty (or was invested in real estate owned by the counterparty), with whom the party had contact on behalf of the counterparty, within the last twelve (12) months of its consultancy with the counterparty, to terminate or reduce its business with the counterparty.

Document 3 (Section 7.2) states that during the consultancy and for a period of twelve (12) months after termination, the consultant is restricted from soliciting customers of the company.

Document 4 (Section 10) does not explicitly restrict the counterparty from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the NFLA (National Football League Associates) after the contract ends, but it does state that the counterparty, after termination, shall not advertise, promote, distribute, or sell any item in connection with the use of any name, figure, design, logo, trademark, or trade name similar to or suggestive of the NFLA.

Document 2 (Clause 10.1) states that any improvements, enhancements, modifications, or developments to a Party's intellectual property shall automatically vest in that Party, regardless of who generates the relevant improvement. This suggests that the intellectual property remains with the original Party.

However, Document 2 (Clause 10.4) implies that one Party may be liable for infringement of the other Party's intellectual property rights.

Document 4 (Section 1) provides an example where intellectual property is specifically assigned to another Party. It states that the Company (Sony) has agreed to sell certain assets, rights, and properties to the Purchaser (GSI Technology), and the Purchaser has agreed to purchase these assets, including certain intellectual property related to the SRAM products.

Document 3, Section 15.7, states that ""No party may assign any of its rights, obligations or privileges (except by operation of law or other corporate reorganization) hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party..."" This suggests that a change of control may be considered a form of assignment or reorganization, which would require the consent of the other party.
