Document 5, Section 9.5 (a) states that each party understands and acknowledges that the other party's Group may now market or have under development products that are competitive with products or services now offered or that may be offered by it and/or members of its Group. This suggests that the parties acknowledge and accept that they may be competitors.

The clauses are more focused on preventing each party from exploiting relationships that exist between the parties, rather than preventing them from working with other parties.

Additionally, Document 5 (Clause 9.1 and 9.2) contains similar non-circumvention clauses. However, these clauses also do not contain any language that would suggest an exclusive dealing commitment.

Document 5 (Clause 10.1) does contain a provision that suggests that each party retains ownership and control over their respective intellectual property rights, but this does not necessarily imply an exclusive dealing commitment.

This implies that the Subcontractor has a certain level of control over the use of its intellectual property, even after the agreement has been terminated. But it does not explicitly state that source code should be deposited into escrow.

Also, Document 3 does not mention anything about escrow, but it does mention that upon the expiration or termination of the Agreement, or at any time the disclosing party may so request, the disclosing party must be given all Confidential Information of the disclosing party that the other party may then possess or have under its control.

In addition, Document 5 states: ""Licensee shall not have any rights of ownership or other proprietary rights in the Licensed Products or any Documentation by virtue of this Agreement, except for the license grants set forth herein."" This suggests that some license grants may be perpetual.

However, not all license grants are perpetual. According to Document 1, some license terms may extend beyond the expiration or termination of this Agreement, but the duration of these license terms is specified in Schedule A.

This further supports the idea that the contract limits the ability of a party to transfer the license to a third party.

Document 5 also provides a similar restriction, stating that ""Licensee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remove such Title from Licensee's services"" if Licensor no longer has the rights to provide a Title to Licensee.

Document 4 is not directly related to the question, but it does mention that the parties have the right to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances.

Document 5 mentions that each party agrees not to solicit, interfere with, procure, or entice away any employee or contractor of the other party. However, it does not explicitly restrict contracting or soliciting customers or partners.

Document 1 mentions that the parties agree not to hire or allow their respective affiliates to hire any employee of the other party, or any person who was an employee of the other party during the previous six months and who was directly involved in the provision of services under this Agreement. However, it does not explicitly restrict contracting or soliciting customers or partners.

From Document 1, we can see that if certain intellectual property (IP) rights are created or developed jointly by the parties, their ownership is specified in the contract. 

4.2.3.2.1: If the IP rights comprise communication software, related hardware, or user information collected from customers, those rights are owned exclusively by Skype.

4.2.3.2.2: If the IP rights comprise data specifically provided by customers during the billing process, those rights are owned exclusively by the Online Group.

From Document 3, we can see that any improvements, enhancements, modifications, or developments to a Party's intellectual property shall automatically vest in that Party, irrespective of who generates the improvement.

However, Document 10.6 states that each Party grants to the other Party a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free licence to use the other Party's Intellectual Property Rights as far as strictly necessary to comply with its marketing and promotional obligations under this Agreement.

In these cases, no notice appears to be required. 

However, if the assignment is to a subsidiary (Document 4, Section F), it is not specified whether notice is required, but it is stated that UTK may assign this Agreement or any portion of its Compensation to its subsidiaries in its sole discretion.

In all other cases, a notice of assignment must be given to the other party within 30 days of the assignment (Document 1, Section 9.2)."

Document 1 states that ""either party may assign this Agreement in its entirety without the other party's consent to any of the following: (i) the assignor's successor in a consolidation or merger, (ii) the assignor's successor in an acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets, equity or beneficial interests of the assignor, (iii) an entity under common control with, controlled by or in control of the assignor, or (iv) a lender, as an assignment of collateral to secure credit extended to the assignor.""

This means that the assignor can assign the contract to these specific entities without the other party's consent, and the assignor is only required to give written notice within 30 days of the assignment.

However, consent is still required for assignments to other third parties, and for assignments by the assignor to entities that are not specifically listed in Document 1."

It states that SpinCo may sublicense the Licensed RemainCo Intellectual Property to Affiliates of SpinCo, even if they become Affiliates after the Distribution Date. This implies that the license grant is not limited to SpinCo itself, but also extends to its affiliates.

However, it is not explicitly stated in the contract that the original licensee (Licensee) has a license grant to its affiliates. The contract only mentions that SpinCo may sublicense to its affiliates, but it does not mention the original licensee's affiliates. Therefore, the answer depends on the specific wording of the contract and the parties involved.

In Document 1, it is mentioned that the Licensee may sublicense the Licensed Products to Redistributors and Customers, but it does not explicitly mention the Licensee's affiliates.

In Document 5, it is mentioned that the Licensee shall not, and shall obligate Redistributors not to, make or pass on to Customers any warranty or representation on behalf of Licensor inconsistent with or in addition to the limited warranty contained in the Sublicense.

However, it also mentions that for Titles where the license term specified in Schedule A extends beyond the expiration or termination of the Agreement, the licenses will survive for the duration of the applicable license term.

Additionally, Document 3, Section 2.7 [NATURE OF GRANT] and Document 5, Section 2.8 [TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHT] also contain language that suggests a non-exclusive license grant that is not explicitly stated to be irrevocable or perpetual.

Furthermore, Document 4, Section 2.7 [NATURE OF GRANT] states that Licensee shall not have any rights of ownership or other proprietary rights in the Licensed Products or any Documentation by virtue of this Agreement, except for the license grants set forth herein.

Therefore, the license grant in the contract does contain provisions that suggest certain rights are granted for perpetual periods, but it also contains language that may imply a revocable or non-exclusive license grant for certain Titles or purposes.
