From Document 2, section 6.1, it is clear that each party acknowledges that the other party's Confidential Information is valuable and unique, and that disclosure of such information without consent will result in irreparable injury to its owner. However, this does not specify ownership of intellectual property created jointly by the parties.

The contract appears to be a standard agreement with a fixed term, as mentioned in various sections (e.g., Section 3.2 Terms of Payment). The term for payment varies, but it implies that the agreement has a specific duration.

However, there are some statements that could be interpreted as limiting the termination of the license grant, but these statements do not guarantee irrevocability or perpetuity. For example:

- Document 3 states that ""Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Licensee to distribute, exhibit or otherwise use any Title."" This does not necessarily imply that the license grant is irrevocable or perpetual.
- Document 4 mentions that ""Nothing in this Agreement limits or restricts Licensee from entering into any similar agreements with any third party."" This might be seen as giving Licensee some flexibility or freedom to exit the agreement, but it does not explicitly guarantee the perpetuity of the license grant.

Document 2 indicates that ""Nothing herein shall grant a party any right, title or interest in the other party's Intellectual Property, except as explicitly set forth herein.""

Document 4 provides an example of an exception, where intellectual property rights are jointly created by the parties and are owned exclusively by one party (either Skype or Online BVI) depending on the nature of the rights.

Document 5 also provides a scenario where one party (Janssen or its Affiliate) may need to obtain a license to intellectual property from a third party to commercialize a product, and in this case, the costs associated with such a license are solely the responsibility of Janssen and its Affiliate.

Document 1, Section 5.3, states that at no time during or after the Term of this Agreement shall a party challenge or assist others to challenge the other party's Intellectual Property or the registration thereof. This suggests that a party is restricted from contesting the validity of the counterparty's intellectual property ownership.

However, Document 2, Section 5.8, suggests that a party may disclose Confidential Information in patent applications to the extent necessary to provide requisite support for claims therein, and the non-prosecuting Party will have the right to review and comment on the scope and content of the proposed disclosure. This implies that a party may have some limited ability to contest the validity of the counterparty's intellectual property ownership in certain circumstances.

As for unrelated claims, it's not clear if a party is restricted from bringing a claim against the counterparty for matters unrelated to the contract. The context documents do not provide any explicit information on this point.

Here are the relevant findings:

- Document 3 does not mention termination without cause. It mentions termination for breach of contract.

- Document 5 (Section 8) does mention termination without cause, but with a 60-day waiting period following written notice to the breaching party.

- Document 4 (Section 4.2) does not mention termination without cause. It mentions termination for material breach or bankruptcy.

- Document 1 does not mention termination without cause. It mentions termination for insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or material breach.

- Document 2 does not mention termination without cause. It mentions termination for various events, including bankruptcy or insolvency.

In conclusion, based on the provided context documents, we can see that termination without cause is mentioned in Document 5, but with a 60-day waiting period. However, in other documents, termination is mentioned as being due to specific events. Therefore, the answer is that some documents suggest that termination without cause is possible (with a waiting period), but it's not universally applicable to all contracts in the provided context documents."

Additionally, Document 2 states that Licensee may make available the Licensed Products or Documentation to any Redistributor or Customer who wishes to test the Licensed Products on a trial basis, which implies that the license grant extends to the affiliates of such Licensee/sublicensor.

- Document 1, Section 5.3, requires a party not to challenge or assist others to challenge the other party's Intellectual Property or the registration thereof.
- Document 2, Section 5.9, (a) states that each party may enforce the Patents or other intellectual property rights it solely owns, but does not explicitly address the validity of the counterparty's ownership of intellectual property. However, Section 5.9 (b) does state that the parties shall confer and consult before taking any action to enforce or defend any Joint IP.
- Document 5, Section 10.4, requires each party to indemnify the other party against all costs, claims, losses, expenses, and damages incurred by the other party as a result of any infringement by that party of the other party's Intellectual Property Rights.

It seems that a party is restricted from challenging the counterparty's intellectual property rights within the context of the contract, especially when it comes to joint IP. However,"

Document 1 mentions that ""Members will not be jointly or severally liable for the actions of the other Members"" (Section 60) and that ""Members will provide services to one another on an arms' length basis while remaining independent business entities"" (Section 60). This suggests that the parties are not making any commitments to procure all requirements from one party or to refrain from working with other parties.

However, Document 3 mentions that ""nothing in this Agreement shall create or imply an association, partnership, or joint venture between the Parties, it being agreed and understood that the Parties are independent contractors"" (Section 14.3). This also implies that the parties are not making any exclusive commitments to each other.

In Document 1, it is stated that the contract may be terminated ""without any liability or obligation of the terminating party"" if the other party breaches any of its obligations in any material respect, which is not remedied within 30 days following written notice. However, this is a termination for cause.

Document 2 states that a party may terminate the contract ""without prejudice to any right or remedy"" if a petition is presented or a proceeding is commenced for the winding-up, insolvency, administration, reorganisation, reconstruction, dissolution, or bankruptcy of the other party. This appears to be a termination without cause.

Document 3 does not explicitly state that a party can terminate the contract without cause, but it does state that either party may cancel the contract if it becomes evident that the other party will commit a breach of contract entitling to cancellation. This is a termination based on the anticipation of a future breach, rather than an existing breach.
