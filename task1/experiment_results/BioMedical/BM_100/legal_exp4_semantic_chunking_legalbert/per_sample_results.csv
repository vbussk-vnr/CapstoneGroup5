However, Document 3 (Section 3.4) mentions that if the aggregate Price calculated by the accounting firm is less than 95% of the Price established by the Manufacturer, the Manufacturer shall refund the overpayment to the Customer. On the other hand, if the Price is more than 105% of the established Price, the Customer shall promptly pay the Manufacturer for the underpayment.

Document 5 mentions that if a product becomes the subject of a claim or suit for infringement or misappropriation, the Supplier shall take certain actions, but it does not mention any threshold for use.

Document 4 mentions a discussion between the Parties for an additional equipment or capacity request, but it does not specify any threshold for use or a consent requirement.

Document 1 mentions obtaining Required Consents for the third-party agreements, but it does not specify any threshold for use.

Therefore, based on the provided information, there is no clear answer to the question of whether there is a fee increase or consent requirement if one party's use of the product/services exceeds a certain threshold."

Document 1, section (a) states that each party may enforce its own intellectual property rights, including defending against assertions of invalidity or ownership. This suggests that a party is free to contest the validity of the counterparty's ownership.

Document 5, Section 8.1 explicitly states that ""No Party shall have any obligation to institute or maintain any action or suit against any Third Party for infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property licensed hereunder..."" and then goes on to exclude defending actions related to validity of Intellectual Property. However, this section does not explicitly restrict a party's ability to contest the validity of the counterparty's ownership of intellectual property.

Additionally, Document 4, Section 12.2.1 mentions that the liability of any party to this agreement does not include compensation for damages such as loss of profits, expenditures, or opportunity, and further states that ""in no event shall any party to this agreement be liable to the other parties to this agreement for special, indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive or consequential damages."""

1. Document 1: For Finished Product, there is a Minimum Order Quantity for each applicable Product as set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum. However, if the Customer places an order that exceeds this minimum, they must place additional orders for the excess quantities in specified Increments above the minimum order quantity. 

2. Document 3: There is no mention of a minimum order quantity or amount in this document.

3. Document 4: There is no mention of a minimum order quantity or amount in this document.

4. Document 5: This document does not mention a minimum order quantity or amount.

Document 2 mentions selling at least the total minimum of Securities within a specific period, but this is about the Company selling Securities, not a minimum order quantity for one party to buy from the counterparty.

So, to answer your question, yes, there is a minimum order quantity or amount specified in Document 1 for Finished Product."

Document 1 restricts a party from soliciting, interfering with, or enticing away employees or contractors of the other party for a period of six months after the contract ends.

Document 2 restricts the CONSULTANT from soliciting employees and contractors of the Company for a period of twelve months after the termination of its consultancy.

Document 3 restricts both parties from hiring employees of the other party or any person who was an employee of the other party during the previous six months for a period of one year after the contract ends.

Document 5 restricts each party from hiring, soliciting, contracting for, or causing to be solicited, the employment or services of any current or previous employee of the other party for a period of five years after the contract ends.

Therefore, the restrictions on hiring or soliciting employees and contractors from the counterparty are in place both during the contract and for various periods of time after the contract ends, depending on the specific document."

- Document 2 states that Pretzel Time may elect not to renew the Franchise Agreement with written notice not less than six (6) months prior to the expiration of the term.
- Document 4 states that the Customer or i-on must give notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term.
- Document 5 states that either party must serve written notice of its intention not to renew at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the then current term.

Therefore, the notice period required to terminate a renewal varies between 6 months, 15 days, and 90 days depending on the specific agreement or document."

However, Document 5 contains a provision that prohibits a party from using or referencing the other party's name, logos, or trademarks in advertising, sales promotion, press releases, or other communication relating to the Agreement without the other party's prior written consent.

The documents do discuss confidentiality, non-disclosure, and the handling of confidential information, but they do not specifically mention escrow arrangements for source code.

Document 4 discusses third-party agreements, where each party transfers or acquires certain rights and obligations, but these agreements are related to existing contracts with third parties (e.g., Equifax and Certegy), not source code.

Document 5 mentions confidentiality and non-disclosure of information, including the terms of the agreement, business plans, technology, products, and services. However, it does not mention source code or escrow arrangements.

Therefore, based on the provided context documents, there is no requirement for one party to deposit its source code into escrow with a third party."

Document 3 states that ""The Parties agree that the relationship contemplated by this Agreement is a nonexclusive engagement/venture and that each Party now renders and may continue to render consulting services and/or sell or provide products to other companies that may or may not conduct activities similar to those of each other Party."" This suggests a nonexclusive relationship.

Also, Document 1 mentions non-solicitation, but it's not about preventing the parties from collaborating or working with other parties. Instead, it's about preventing the parties from soliciting or enticing away each other's employees or contractors.

Document 5 allows for assignment of obligations to a successor in business or an acquirer of all or substantially all of the business or assets, but this doesn't necessarily imply an exclusive dealing commitment.

However, Document 2 does mention that MediWound may not assign its rights or obligations without the prior written consent of the other party, except in certain circumstances. This could be seen as a restriction on collaboration or working with other parties, but it's not a complete prohibition.

In summary, while there are some restrictions on collaboration and working with other parties, there is no explicit exclusive dealing"

- Document 5: (Although not explicitly stated as ""without cause"", it can be inferred that if a party fails to make any payment of any sum of money specified in this Agreement, the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement; however, it is worth noting that payment is typically considered a cause for termination.)
