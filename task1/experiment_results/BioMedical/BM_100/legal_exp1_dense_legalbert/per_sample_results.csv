This suggests that the licensor (D2) will offer the buyer (LICENSEE) the same terms as it offers to other licensees if the buyer requires additional functionality or technology that is not already included in the original agreement.

From Document 4, Section 11.1, it appears that the manufacturer is required to maintain certain types and amounts of insurance coverage, which would suggest that there is a cap on the manufacturer's liability.

Article 1 of Document 4 defines ""Redistributor"" as any individual or entity that is granted a license by Licensee to copy and sublicense one or more Licensed Products to Customers. This implies that the Licensee can grant licenses to its affiliates, as well as to other entities, to act as Redistributors.

Additionally, Document 2 does not specify any restrictions on the license grant that would prevent the Licensee or its affiliates from sublicensing the Licensed Products.

Document 1 does mention that if a refund (or credit or offset) of any Service Taxes borne by the customer is received, the manufacturer or its affiliate receiving such refund shall promptly pay over the amount of such refund to the customer. This provision is related to tax refunds and does not imply a sharing of revenue or profit.

This suggests that a change of control through a merger or sale of substantially all assets may not require consent.

""...to market and sublicense Sublicense Copies and copies of the Documentation, together with any copies of promotional and other materials which Licensor may produce or obtain from time to time to assist Licensee in marketing and sublicensing the Licensed Products during the term of this Agreement...""

Additionally, Document 1 states that this Venture is termed a contractual joint venture and will not constitute a partnership.

Additionally, there is no language in the contract that prohibits the parties from collaborating or working with other parties.

Document 2 mentions that the parties agree not to use the name of the other party in any advertising, promotional or sales materials without consent (Paragraph 3.7), but this does not constitute an exclusive dealing commitment.

Document 3 states that each party may make disclosures relating to the product or the terms and conditions of this Agreement in accordance with applicable laws (Paragraph 14.1), which does not imply an exclusive dealing commitment.

Document 5 does not mention any exclusive dealing commitment, but rather discusses the parties' obligations related to environmental and health and safety practices.

Document 1 mentions termination without cause due to insolvency, bankruptcy, or breach of obligations in a material respect. However, it does not explicitly state that a party can terminate without cause solely by giving a notice and allowing a waiting period to expire.

Document 2 does not provide clear evidence that a party can terminate without cause.

Document 3 mentions termination without cause, stating that ""Either Party may cancel this Agreement already prior to the date of its fulfillment, if it becomes evident that the other Party will commit a breach of contract entitling to cancellation of this Agreement.""

Document 4 states that a party can terminate this Agreement due to material breach after a 60-day notice period, but it does not explicitly state that a party can terminate without cause.

Document 5 mentions termination without cause due to material breach after a 60-day notice period.

Based on the context, it is unclear whether a party can terminate this contract without cause solely by giving a notice and allowing a waiting period to expire. Some documents provide conditions under which a party can terminate without cause, while others imply that termination without cause is not possible.

Document 4 states that the Agreement ""shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Agent, the Company, the MHCs, and the Bank and their respective successors."" This means that these parties, even if they are not signatories to the agreement, can still benefit from the agreement and enforce their rights against the contracting parties.

Document 4 also lists ""controlling persons and the partners, officers, and directors referred to in Sections 6 and 7 and their heirs and legal representatives"" as beneficiaries of the agreement. This suggests that even individuals who are not parties to the agreement can be beneficiaries of certain clauses.

Document 5 also mentions that the obligations of the Fund under the agreement are binding only on the assets and property of the Fund, and not on individual officers, trustees, or shareholders. However, this does not necessarily mean that these individuals are non-contracting parties who can enforce their rights against the contracting parties.

From Document 4, Section 1.6 defines ""Redistributor"" as ""any individual or entity that is granted a license by Licensee to copy and sublicense one or more Licensed Products to Customers."" This indicates that the license grant extends to individuals or entities that sublicense the Licensed Products to customers.

Additionally, from Document 1, Section 15.1 states that ""the relationship existing between Licensee and Licensor is one of an independent contractor, and this Agreement shall not be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture, agency relationship or as granting a franchise under federal or any state law."" However, it does not explicitly mention affiliates.

From Document 1, Section 2.6, however, the terms of agreements for Redistributor Agreements and sublicenses executed in connection with the Licensed Products do not convey any rights of ownership in the Licensed Products or Documentation to any individual or entity other than Licensor, except for the license rights granted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. This might imply that affiliates are covered under this exception.

Document 5 does have a section regarding licenses, specifically Section 4, but it does not include any language about an ""all you can eat"" or unlimited usage license. Instead, it outlines the terms and conditions for using intellectual property and explicitly states that the rights granted to each party exist solely for the purposes of performance of the agreement.

Document 4 mentions that each party may make disclosures about the Product or the terms and conditions of the agreement, but it does not grant any license or usage rights.

The other documents do not contain any language related to ""all you can eat"" or unlimited usage licenses either.
