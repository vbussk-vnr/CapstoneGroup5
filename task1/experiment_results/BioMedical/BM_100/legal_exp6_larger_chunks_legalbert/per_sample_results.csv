However, this source code shall remain the property of Garman unless Sparkling (the counterparty) exercises its option to purchase as specified in the Source Code Agreement.

Upon the occurrence of certain events, such as bankruptcy or insolvency, Sparkling may be entitled to use the source code. This can be inferred from Section (b) of the Source Code Escrow, which states that Sparkling shall be entitled to utilize the license to use and reproduce the Codes, including the source code, in the event of Garman's default or if Garman ceases to support the Software as required.

Additionally, according to United States Bankruptcy Code section 365(n) or any similar provisions in any jurisdiction, the bankruptcy of Garman shall not prevent Sparkling's continued use of the Work or the Codes in accordance with the license agreement.

In Document 2, section (h) ""Assignment"", it is stated that neither party may assign its rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement to any third party in whole or in part, without the other party's prior written consent. This suggests that any transfer of the license must be approved by the other party.

Additionally, in Document 3, section 4, it is stated that LICENSEE's Customer may transfer a licensed copy of the Licensed Technology to a third party, but only if the third party agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of the LICENSEE's Customer Agreement. This implies that the transfer of the license is subject to certain conditions and restrictions.

However, it does mention that the Licensor has been granted the right to grant the rights provided by the Licensor to plan_b under this Agreement, if the Licensor is not the sole and exclusive owner of all of the intellectual property rights to the Content (Document 1, Section 5.2). This suggests that the Licensor may have affiliates or third-party rights holders, but it does not explicitly state that a license grant by these affiliates is included in the contract.

Regarding the inclusion of intellectual property of affiliates of the Licensor, Document 1, Section 5.4 mentions that the Licensor warrants that the Content does not infringe an intellectual property right enforceable in the agreed country of delivery or use. This suggests that the Content may include intellectual property rights of third parties, including affiliates of the Licensor. However, it does not explicitly state that a license grant for these intellectual property rights is included in the contract.

Therefore, the answer to the question is that the contract does not explicitly contain a license grant by affiliates of the Licensor or that includes intellectual property of affiliates of the Licensor, but it may imply the inclusion of third-party intellectual property rights."

Document 3: Section 7.1 of Document 3 restricts the consultant from soliciting employees of the company for a period of 12 months after the termination of consultancy. However, there is no restriction on soliciting customers.

Document 4: There is no restriction on contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty.

Document 5: Section 15.9 of Document 5 restricts each party from hiring or soliciting the employment or services of any current or previous employee of the other party for a period of 5 years after the contract ends. However, there is no restriction on soliciting customers.

However, we can infer some information from other sections of the documents:

Document 2, Section 7.4, states that after termination of the contract, the plan_b shall cease to use Content for any purpose and delete Content from any files and data storage. This might imply that parties should not use each other's content or services after the contract ends.

In summary, there is no explicit restriction on contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty,"

However, in Document 2, Section 7.4, it is mentioned that upon termination or cancellation of the contract, there shall be a sell-off period following the date of termination of the contract. But this does not seem to be related to liquidated damages or termination fees.

Document 4, however, mentions that in case of a dispute, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party its costs and fees, including attorneys' fees, associated with such arbitration. But this is in the context of arbitration and not specifically related to termination fees.

Document 5, Section C, mentions that except as otherwise specifically stated in the Agreement, neither party will be liable to the other for damages in any form by reason of the expiration or earlier termination of the Agreement. This suggests that there are no termination fees mentioned in this document either.

However, I'll point out the most relevant ones.

1. Document 1, Section 2.1(e)(i) discusses exclusivity, stating that during the Exclusivity Period, the Customer must purchase at least the Exclusive Purchase Requirement of its requirements for a particular Product SKU from the Manufacturer. This is an exclusive dealing commitment, where the Customer agrees to procure all or a significant portion of its requirements from the Manufacturer.

2. Document 5, Section 3, mentions that the Agreement shall be valid for five years, and for the purpose of clarity, the second year starts on February 1, 2020, and the third year starts on February 1, 2021. However, it does not explicitly mention an exclusive dealing commitment.

3. Document 5, Section 7.2 states that Allied shall not endorse or permit the marketing of any other company whose principal business is as an e-commerce provider at or in connection with the Arena. However, this is not a blanket prohibition on working with other parties but rather a specific restriction related to endorsements and marketing.

In Document 4 (Section 2.10), it mentions ""reasonable technical support"" for a period of time, but it does not specify the duration of the warranty period.
