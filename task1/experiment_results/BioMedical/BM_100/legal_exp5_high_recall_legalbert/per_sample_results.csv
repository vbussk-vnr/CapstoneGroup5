In Document 1, Section 2.1(e)(i), it mentions an Exclusive Purchase Requirement. However, it does not specifically state that there will be a fee increase or consent requirement if the customer's use of the product/services exceeds a certain threshold.

However, Document 6, particularly Section 2.5, mentions a Triggering Event that suspends the Exclusive Purchase Requirement. If a Triggering Event occurs, the customer's Exclusive Purchase Requirement with respect to the affected product(s) is temporarily suspended.

Document 6, Section 2.5(c) also mentions that upon the expiration of the Exclusive Purchase Requirement Suspension Period, the customer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resume ordering from the manufacturer, on a product-by-product basis, the affected product(s) in accordance with its Exclusive Purchase Requirement during the Exclusivity Period.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that there may be consequences if the customer's use of the product/services exceeds certain thresholds or if a Triggering Event occurs, but the specifics of these consequences are not clearly outlined in the provided documents."

Document 1 (Section 4.2.3.2) states that if intellectual property rights are created or developed jointly by the parties, they are owned exclusively by Skype if they comprise communication software or related communication hardware, user names, and user profile information, or database incorporating the same. This means that in this specific scenario, the intellectual property created jointly is owned by Skype.

Document 2 (Section 10.1) states that any improvements, enhancements, modifications, or developments to a party's intellectual property shall automatically vest in that party, irrespective of who generates the relevant improvement. This suggests that in general, intellectual property created by one party remains the property of that party.

Document 4 (Section 1) states that the purchasing party, GSI Technology, Inc., shall have the right to file patent applications for inventions that were created or developed prior to the distribution date, jointly with Sony Electronics Inc.

However, it does not specifically address uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.

This suggests that there may be a provision for termination fees or penalties, but it is not explicitly stated.

Similarly, Document 6 mentions a ""Termination Event"" that can trigger termination of the Agreement, but it does not specify any liquidated damages or termination fees.

Document 9 mentions that upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, the licenses granted to Distributor will immediately terminate, and all fees due to IMNTV will be paid to IMNTV. However, this does not necessarily imply a termination fee, but rather a provision for payment of existing fees.

In general, the context documents appear to focus on the rights and obligations of the parties, termination procedures, and limitations of liability, rather than explicit provisions for liquidated damages or termination fees."
