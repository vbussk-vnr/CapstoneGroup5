However, Document 1 mentions the ""Exclusive Purchase Requirement"" in Section 2.1(e)(i), which requires the customer to purchase at least this requirement from the manufacturer for a specific product SKU in a specific country. However, this is not related to a fee increase or consent requirement due to exceeding a threshold.

Document 4 mentions that if the manufacturer experiences delays in the manufacture, release, or supply of a particular product, the customer may be released from its obligation to purchase the product within a certain timeframe. However, this is not related to a fee increase or consent requirement due to exceeding a threshold.

Document 5 is not directly related to the question, as it discusses indemnification and remedies for infringement.

Therefore, based on the provided context documents, there is no information about a fee increase or consent requirement if one party's use of the product/services exceeds a certain threshold."

From Document 1, we can see that if intellectual property rights are created or developed jointly, certain rights are owned exclusively by Skype (4.2.3.2.1) or Online BVI (4.2.3.2.2).

From Document 2, we can see that any improvements, enhancements, modifications, or developments to a Party's intellectual property shall automatically vest in that Party, irrespective of who generates the relevant improvement (10.1). This suggests that the original owner retains ownership of their intellectual property.

From Document 3, Exhibit A, we can see that the Recipient, Kathy Whitworth, assigns all their rights in any Intellectual Property to the Company, SQUARE TWO GOLF, INC. (f). This suggests that the Company gains ownership of the intellectual property created by the Recipient.

Yes, the contract contains a license grant to a licensee and the affiliates of such licensee/sublicensor.

From Document 1, Section 2.1, we see that Licensor grants to Licensee a non-exclusive right to use the Master Copy of each Licensed Product. This license grant does not explicitly mention the affiliates of the Licensee.

However, from Document 5, Section 2, we see that MSCI grants to MS a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license that includes the right to sublicense to any business purpose. This license grant explicitly mentions the affiliates of the licensee (MS) in Section 5(a), where it excludes the liability of the members of the MS Provider Group (including MS's affiliates and subsidiaries).

It is worth noting that the license grant in Document 1 does not explicitly include the affiliates of the Licensee. However, based on the language used in Document 2, which mentions that certain sections shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement and apply to the Licensee and its affiliates, it is possible to infer that the license grant in Document 1 may implicitly apply to the affiliates of the Licensee.

Document 3 (Section 7.2 Solicitation of Customers) states that the consultant (or in this context, the ""Party"") agrees not to solicit, entice, or induce any Customer (defined as a person or entity to which the Company provided products or services) to terminate or reduce its business with the Company, for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of its consultancy with the Company.

Document 2 (Section 7.2) does not explicitly state that a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty.

From Document 2 (Clause 10.1), it is stated that ""any improvements, enhancements, modifications or developments to a Party's intellectual property shall automatically vest in that Party irrespective of who generates the relevant improvement, enhancement, modification or development."" This suggests that the intellectual property remains the property of the original party, even if created by the other party.

However, from Document 4 (Section 1.2), it is stated that ""all new discoveries, inventions, improvements, processes, formulae, designs, drawings, training materials, original works of authorship, photos, video tapes, electronic images, documentation, trademarks and copyrights (the ""Intellectual Property""), that may be developed, conceived, or made by Recipient, alone or jointly with others during her work for the Company, shall be the exclusive property of the Company and shall be deemed a work for hire.""

""This Agreement may not be assigned by a party to this Agreement to any other Person without the express written approval of the other parties to this Agreement and any attempt at assignment in violation of this section shall be null and void.""

However, Document 3 Section 15.7 also provides an exception for ""a successor in business or an acquirer of all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this Agreement pertains without obtaining the consent of the other party.""

It can be inferred that if a party undergoes a change of control, such as a merger, stock sale, transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or business, or assignment by operation of law, the assigning party does not necessarily require explicit consent of the counterparty to terminate their obligations under the agreement. 

However, the agreement does not explicitly state that the other party has the right to terminate the agreement upon a change of control. Instead, it focuses on the exceptions in which the other party's consent is not required for assignment or change of control.

Therefore, the answer is that while consent or notice is generally required for assignment or change of control, there are some exceptions specified in the agreement that may allow for termination without the counterparty's consent"

This implies that each party has post-termination obligations to pay any outstanding sums.

- Document 3: EFFECT OF TERMINATION states that the provisions relating to property rights and confidentiality shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement. This suggests that at least the property rights and confidentiality provisions will continue after termination.

""(a) will not, whether alone or in collaboration with any Third Party or for itself or any Third Party, during the promotion of any product, compare such product (other than the Product) with the Product in any aspect nor disparage the Product in any manner,""
