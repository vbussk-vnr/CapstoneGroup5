However, this clause does not provide for joint or shared ownership of intellectual property, but rather for the ownership and control of intellectual property to be transferred from one party to the other.

1. **Document 1**: Section 10.1 states that all intellectual property rights vested in a party prior to the agreement remain vested in that party. Section 10.3 states that the license granted in Clause 10.2 expires at the end of the term of the agreement. This implies that any intellectual property created after the agreement is signed may not automatically become the property of the counterparty.
2. **Document 2**: Exhibit A, Section (f) states that any new discoveries, inventions, improvements, etc. made by the recipient during work for the company shall be the exclusive property of the company. This implies that the company has a clear ownership of any intellectual property created by the recipient during the agreement.
3. **Document 3**: Section 3.5 states that each party owns its own inventions and intellectual property rights, unless otherwise stated.

Additionally, Document 3 states that ""each Party now renders and may continue to render consulting services and/or sell or provide products to other companies that may or may not conduct activities similar to those of each other Party."" This further supports the notion that there is no exclusive dealing commitment.

Document 1 does contain a non-solicitation clause, but it only prohibits soliciting or enticing away employees or contractors of the other party, and not a commitment to procure all requirements from one party or a prohibition on collaborating or working with other parties.

Document 1 suggests that the Licensor's rights and obligations may be assigned to its affiliates or subsidiaries, and the Licensee's rights and obligations may be assigned to its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of its business or assets. However, it does not explicitly address the transfer of the license to third parties.

Document 3 indicates that the Licensee has the right to sublicense its rights granted under the Agreement to third parties, but only with prior written notice to the Licensor and subject to certain limitations.

Document 4 does not directly address the transfer of the license.

Document 5 states that neither party shall assign or transfer the Agreement to any third party, without the prior written consent of the other party.

Document 5, Section 8.1 explicitly states: ""No Party shall have any obligation to institute or maintain any action or suit against any Third Party for infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property licensed hereunder... which claims that any Intellectual Property licensed to the other Party infringes or constitutes misappropriation of the Intellectual Property rights of any Third Party.""

However, this section does not restrict a party from contesting the validity of the counterparty's ownership of intellectual property in a dispute unrelated to Third Parties. 

Additionally, it is worth noting that Document 1, subsection (b) suggests that the parties will consult each other in cases of disputes with Third Parties regarding Joint IP.

However, in Document 4, it's mentioned that for certain projects (listed in Schedule A6 of Schedule A), the license grant is limited to certain durations, as detailed in Schedule A6 of Schedule A. This suggests that the license grant may not be perpetual for those specific projects.

- The assigning party must provide the counterparty with notice of the assignment.
- The assignee must assume the assigning party's obligations in a written instrument and provide a copy to the counterparty.
- The assignment must be accompanied by a simultaneous assignment of the Other Agreements to the same assignee, and the assigning party's interest in the Purchased Assets to the same assignee, unless otherwise agreed by the other party in advance, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld.

No, consent or notice is not always required of a party if the contract is assigned to a third party. However, the specific circumstances determine whether consent or notice is required.

For example:

- In Document 1, consent is required if the Licensee assigns its rights and obligations to a third party (a non-Affiliate).
- In Document 2, if a party assigns the contract to a third party in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of its business or assets, notice of the assignment is required, but the other party's consent is not. However, the assignee must assume the assigning party's obligations in a written instrument.
- In Document 3, Skype or Skype Holding can assign the contract to a third party without consent in the event of a merger, reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets.
- In Document 4, no consent is required for a party to assign its rights and obligations to a third party acquiring all of its business, but the third party must covenant to comply with the provisions of the contract.
- In Document 5, the specific requirements for obtaining ""Required Consents"" from third-party providers are detailed, but it does not"

- Document 2 specifies that if the Franchisee does not execute and return the renewal Franchise Agreement within thirty (30) days of receipt, then the Agreement shall terminate. However, this is not a termination notice period, but rather a deadline for executing the renewal agreement.
- Document 2 also states that Pretzel Time may elect not to renew the Franchise Agreement with reasonable cause and upon written notice, not less than six (6) months prior to the expiration of the term.
- Document 5 specifies that the renewal shall terminate unless either party serves written notice of its intention not to renew, on the other at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the then current term.

Document 5, Section 8.1 explicitly states: ""No Party shall have any obligation to institute or maintain any action or suit against any Third Party for infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property licensed hereunder, or to defend any action or suit brought by a Third Party which challenges or concerns the validity of any such Intellectual Property..."" This section applies to actions against third parties, not the counterparty.

However, Document 1 section (b) requires the parties to confer and consult on disputes with third parties regarding joint intellectual property, and that neither party shall take any action to enforce or defend any joint IP without the other party's prior written consent.

Document 1 restricts a party from soliciting, interfering with, or enticing away employees or contractors of the other party during the contract term and for 6 months thereafter. 

Document 2 outlines the process for termination of the contract due to default. However, it does not specifically restrict a party from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty.
