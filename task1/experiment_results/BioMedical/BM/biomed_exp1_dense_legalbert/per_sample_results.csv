This indicates that the Licensee is granted the right to sublicense the Licensed Products to Redistributors and Customers.

Additionally, in Document 4, Article 1.6, the term ""Redistributor"" is defined, but it does not explicitly limit the sublicense to only the licensee, but rather allows sublicensing to Redistributors and Customers.

Furthermore, Document 5 does not mention the inclusion of intellectual property of affiliates of the licensor in the license grant. Document 5 only refers to the licensor's agreement with a third party for the distribution and exhibition of Licensed Programs and does not mention affiliates.

In the event that a party materially defaults under or materially breaches any of the provisions of this Agreement, the other party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon 60 days' prior written notice...""

This suggests that the contract does grant a license to a licensee (including a sublicensor) for the terms specified in the contract, but does not explicitly grant a license to affiliates of the licensee/sublicensor.

This suggests that the parties are acting independently and may engage in other business relationships or collaborations.

Further, Document 1 states that ""Members will not be jointly or severally liable for the actions of the other Members,"" which implies that the parties are not making any commitments to procure all requirements from one party or to prohibit licensing or selling technology, goods, or services to third parties.

Yes, in some cases, a party may terminate this contract without cause, but only by giving a notice and allowing a waiting period to expire. 

From Document 1, it is not clear if the contract can be terminated without cause. However, it does provide that the contract may be terminated by either party immediately upon notice if the other party becomes insolvent, files a petition in bankruptcy, makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or breaches any of its obligations under the Agreement in any material respect.

From Document 2, it mentions that any procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction analogous to any of the matters referred to in clause (xviii), but does not provide a clear answer to the question.

From Document 3, it mentions that either Party may cancel this Agreement already prior to the date of its fulfillment, if it becomes evident that the other Party will commit a breach of contract entitling to cancellation of this Agreement. However, this is still subject to the other party being able to remedy the breach within 30 days.

From Document 4, it explicitly mentions that this Agreement may be terminated by either party as follows: ""In the event that a party materially"

Based on Document 5, Section 10.2, there is no explicit mention of a category called ""this category."" However, Section 10.2 does mention exceptions to the confidentiality agreement. 

Document 5, Section 10.2, also mentions that the confidentiality agreement does not apply to:

2. Any Confidential Information that becomes public other than by virtue of a breach of this Section 10.2.
3. Any Confidential Information that becomes available to the party from another source that is not subject to a confidentiality agreement with the other party.
