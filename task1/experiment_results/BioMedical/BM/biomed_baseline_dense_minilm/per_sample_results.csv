Document 1 does not provide any information about the ownership of intellectual property created by one party. Document 2 suggests that nothing in the Agreement grants a party any right, title, or interest in the other party's Intellectual Property, except as explicitly set forth.

It's also worth noting that in Document 3, Section 5, there is a clause that discusses the parties' obligations to keep the Agreement confidential, except in certain circumstances.

However, this does not explicitly state that liability is capped, but it does indicate that a party's liability may be limited by the availability of an adequate legal or equitable remedy against another party.

Document 1 mentions that the parties may agree to limit the liability of a party for certain types of breaches, such as breaches of confidentiality obligations (Section 5.8).

Document 1, Section 5.3 states that a party shall not challenge or assist others to challenge the other party's intellectual property or the registration thereof. However, this section does not explicitly address other types of claims against the counterparty.

Document 2, Section 5.8 mentions that if a party decides not to file or prosecute a joint intellectual property right, the other party may continue the prosecution at its own expense. However, this section does not imply any restriction on bringing claims against the counterparty for matters unrelated to the contract.

Document 3, Section 11.4 states that each party represents and warrants that the execution and delivery of the agreement do not conflict with any laws or material contractual obligations.

Document 2 provides a more detailed list of circumstances under which a party may terminate the contract without cause, including if the other party becomes insolvent, is unable to pay its debts, or has a creditor take possession of its business or assets.

Document 3 states that a party may cancel the contract if it becomes evident that the other party will commit a breach of contract entitling the other party to cancellation.
