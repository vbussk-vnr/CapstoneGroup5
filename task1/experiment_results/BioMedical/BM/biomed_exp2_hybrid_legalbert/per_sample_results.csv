From Document 3, Section 3.2, it is stated that ""Such license shall be transferrable subject to the foregoing restriction with any sale or transfer of a SpinCo business that utilizes such Intellectual Property..."" This implies that the license is transferable, but only under certain conditions, specifically in the event of a sale or transfer of a SpinCo business.

Document 4 states that each party's aggregate liability to the other party for all cases and controversies arising out of the subject matter of the agreement, regardless of the cause of action, will be limited to a certain amount (although the exact amount is redacted).

Document 5 also discusses liability caps, specifically stating that neither party's aggregate liability to the other party (or its personnel) under the agreement for the initial 12-month period and for any 12-month period thereafter during the term will exceed 1.5 times the aggregate amounts paid or payable pursuant to the agreement in the preceding 12-month period.

However, neither document indicates that a party's liability is uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract.

Document 1, Section 8.1, states that a party shall have no obligation to institute or maintain any action or suit against any Third Party for infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property licensed under the Agreement. However, this does not explicitly restrict a party from contesting the validity of the counterparty's ownership of intellectual property.

Document 2, Section 5.3, states that a party shall not challenge or assist others to challenge the other party's Intellectual Property or the registration thereof. However, this does not restrict a party from bringing claims against the counterparty for matters unrelated to the contract.

Document 3, Section 5.9(a), states that each Party may in its sole discretion enforce the Patents or other intellectual property rights it solely owns, as well as to defend against any assertions of invalidity, unenforceability, or ownership of such Patents.

Section 2.1(d) of this document states that Manufacturer may engage such Third-Party contractors, subcontractors, or service providers to perform the same activities without first obtaining Customer's prior written consent, but such use must be approved in advance in writing by Customer. But, there is no mention of the terms being passed on to the customer.

Document 5 discusses the approval of unaffiliated third-party distributors or resellers, but it does not specify that the customer under the contract will be entitled to better terms if a third party gets them.

Document 2 mentions that the marketing fee will be a percentage of the margin received by the other Party, but this does not imply that the customer will be entitled to better terms if a third party gets them.

Document 4 does not explicitly mention joint ownership, but it does state that ""nothing set forth in this Agreement shall be construed to grant to Manufacturer any title, right or interest in or to any Intellectual Property controlled by Customer or any of its Affiliates.""

Document 5 mentions that ""Nothing herein shall grant a party any right, title or interest in the other party's Intellectual Property, except as explicitly set forth herein.""

However, Document 1 explicitly mentions joint ownership, and it seems to be the only clause that provides for joint ownership of intellectual property between the parties to the contract.

Document 1 states that the assignor may assign this Agreement to a lender ""as an assignment of collateral to secure credit extended to the assignor,"" but it does not mention notice or consent in this case.

However, Document 1 also states that the assignor will give the other party written notice within thirty (30) days of any assignment described in the immediately preceding sentence. This suggests that notice is required, but it is not clear if consent is required.

Document 4, Section F, states that the rights and obligations of UTK under this Agreement may not be assigned or delegated without the prior written consent of AVDU. However, this is a specific exception, and it is not clear if it applies to all assignments.

In general, it appears that notice may be required, but consent is only required in certain situations, such as when assigning to a lender or when UTK assigns its rights and obligations to a third party.

To provide a more definitive answer, it is necessary to clarify the specific circumstances of the assignment in question, such as the type of third party involved and the nature of the assignment."

Specifically, in Document 3 (Section 15.1.1), the termination clause allows either party to terminate the agreement if the other party undergoes a change of control, such as a merger, bankruptcy, or receivership, without requiring consent or notice from the counterparty. This clause explicitly states that such events entitle the terminating party to terminate the agreement, without prejudice to its other rights.

Additionally, in Document 5, Section 9.2, it is stated that either party may assign the agreement to its successor in a consolidation or merger, or to an entity under common control, without the other party's consent. However, this provision does not necessarily imply that the assigning party has the right to terminate the agreement upon such assignment.

Therefore, it appears that one party has the right to terminate the agreement upon certain events related to the counterparty, such as a change of control, without requiring consent or notice from the counterparty."

No, consent or notice is not required of a party if the contract is assigned to a third party in the following cases:

1. To the assignor's successor in a consolidation or merger (Document 1, 9.2).
2. To the assignor's successor in an acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets, equity or beneficial interests of the assignor (Document 1, 9.2).
3. To an entity under common control with, controlled by or in control of the assignor (Document 1, 9.2).
4. To a lender, as an assignment of collateral to secure credit extended to the assignor (Document 1, 9.2).

However, the assignor is required to give the other party written notice of the assignment within thirty (30) days (Document 1, 9.2).

But, if the assignment is to a subsidiary of the assignor, it is not clear if consent or notice is required. Document 4, F.

Document 1, Section 8.1 specifically states that no party has an obligation to institute or maintain any action or suit against a third party for infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property licensed under the agreement. This suggests that parties are free to contest the validity of intellectual property ownership in cases unrelated to infringement or misappropriation.

Additionally, Document 3, Section 5.9(a) allows each party to enforce its own patents and other intellectual property rights, and to defend against any assertions of invalidity, unenforceability, or ownership of such patents.

This only refers to actions against third parties, not the counterparty.

It does not explicitly state that a party can terminate without cause (solely by giving a notice and allowing a waiting period to expire), only that a notice is required for certain breaches.

Document 2 mentions that either party may terminate this agreement and either may terminate a purchase order, effective upon written notice in various events, including a 30-day notice period for breach. However, it does not explicitly state that a party can terminate without cause.
