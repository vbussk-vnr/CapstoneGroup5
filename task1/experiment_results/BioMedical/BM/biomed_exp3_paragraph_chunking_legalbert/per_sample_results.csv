In Document 2, Section 1 grants Hyatt or Playa, as applicable, a ""Right of First Offer"" to acquire the Development Property, and Section 3 provides a ""Right of First Refusal"" to accept a proposed offer or arrangement from a third party.

However, the most detailed and comprehensive clause granting a right of first refusal is in Document 1, Section 2.03(a).

There are also other similar clauses in the provided documents that grant one party a right of first offer or right of first negotiation, such as in Document 5, which grants North a right of first offer to endorse or promote products similar to the Endorsed Product.

Document 4 also mentions the possibility of sublicensing, but it does not explicitly mention a right of first refusal or offer.

Document 3 states that LICENSEE's Customer shall have the right to transfer a licensed copy of the Licensed Technology to a third party provided LICENSEE's Customer does not retain any copies of such licensed copy and the third party agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of this LICENSEE's Customer Agreement.

For example, Document 1 mentions that in the event of a breach of Section 13, a party's liability is not subject to the liability cap. Similarly, Document 1 also mentions that a party's liability is not capped in the event of a breach of customer liabilities pursuant to Section 2.5(e).

Document 4 mentions that a party's liability is not capped in the event of a claim of infringement or misappropriation of any patent, trademark, copyright, or other proprietary right held by any third party, as well as for any claims made pursuant to Section 12.1.

However, in many other cases, a party's liability is capped. For example, Document 1 limits a party's aggregate liability to 1.5 times the aggregate amounts paid or payable pursuant to the Agreement in the preceding 12-month period. Document 2 also states that in no event shall either party be liable for the recovery of any special, indirect, or consequential damages.

However, in some of the documents, there are clauses related to termination and liability. For example, Document 5 mentions that ""Upon termination of the Agreement by NETGEAR for Distributor's breach, NETGEAR may cancel all of Distributor's unfulfilled orders without further obligation."" This does not explicitly mention a termination fee.

Document 5 also mentions that ""Except as otherwise specifically stated in the Agreement, neither party will be liable to the other for damages in any form by reason of the expiration or earlier termination of the Agreement."" 

Document 4 mentions that ""NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS)."" This suggests that the parties may not be liable for certain types of damages upon termination, but it does not explicitly mention liquidated damages or a termination fee.

From Document 5, Section 7.1, it is mentioned that ArTara, Affiliates, and sublicensees will obtain and maintain commercial general liability insurance with a reputable and financially secure insurance carrier, identifying University Indemnitees as additional insureds. This is to ensure that University Indemnitees are protected in case of a claim.

Additionally, from Document 5, Section 7.2, it is mentioned that ArTara will provide University with a certificate of insurance and notices of subsequent renewals for its insurance and that of Affiliates extended rights under this Agreement and of sublicensees. This is to ensure that University has access to the insurance information and can verify that the required insurance is in place.

However, from Document 1, section 5.2 states that if the licensor is not the sole and exclusive owner of the intellectual property rights to the content, the licensor has been granted the right to grant the rights by the owner or rightful sub-licensee of the intellectual property.

Additionally, Document 4, section 2.5 states that the Licensee shall not enter into any agreement referred to in this Article 2 with any Redistributor or Customer until each such agreement has been submitted to and approved by Licensor.
