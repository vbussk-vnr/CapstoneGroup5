Document 3, Section 10.2, defines Confidential Information as including, but not limited to, proprietary information of the other party to the Agreement, which may include intellectual property of the Licensor and its affiliates.

Document 2, Section 7.2, specifically addresses this issue. It states that a party may cancel the agreement if the other party solicits, entices, or induces any customer to terminate or reduce its business with the counterparty. This suggests that a party is restricted from soliciting customers of the counterparty during the contract.

Document 5 mentions a license grant to MS and its affiliates, but it is not a sublicense grant.

Document 9 mentions a sublicense grant to Certegy and states that Certegy may sublicense to its affiliates (Certegy Group members) and further sublicense to their customers. The sublicense agreement with customers includes a restriction on sublicensing and exporting the licensed materials.

Document 1 mentions sublicense agreements with Redistributors and Customers.

Document 7 mentions sublicense rights granted to Redistributors.

Document 10 mentions a license grant to plan_b, but it does not explicitly mention sublicensors or their affiliates.

Document 8 mentions a license grant to Network Affiliate, but it does not explicitly mention sublicensors or their affiliates.

Based on these findings, it appears that some contracts do contain a license grant to sublicensors and their affiliates, but not all of them. The specific terms and conditions of the license grant vary between documents."

ALAMOGORDOFINANCIALCORP_12_16_1999-EX-1-AGENCY AGREEMENT__Unlimited/All-You-Can-Eat-License,"Is there a clause granting one party an “enterprise,” “all you can eat” or unlimited usage license?",0.38636363636363635,0.07575757575757576,0.19607843137254902,1.0,"Based on the provided context documents, I couldn't find any clause specifically granting one party an ""enterprise,"" ""all you can eat,"" or unlimited usage license. However, I found some clauses that might be related to licensing:

Document 3: Section 2.1 grants a non-exclusive, worldwide right to use and reproduce the Master Copy of each Licensed Product and the related Documentation for testing, demonstration to Redistributors and Customers, support and maintenance, if any, back-up and archive purposes. This doesn't necessarily imply unlimited usage, but rather a specific set of purposes.

Document 5: Section 3 Grant of License and Exclusivity grants a non-exclusive right to use North's Likeness and North's Endorsement in all reasonable forms of advertising, but the usage is limited to the Endorsed Product only.

Document 8: Section 5.2 states that nothing herein shall grant a party any right, title, or interest in the other party's Intellectual Property, except as explicitly set forth herein. This suggests that any licensing agreements must be explicitly stated, and there is no implicit unlimited usage clause.

Document 9: The definitions provided in Document 9 do not imply any unlimited usage license.

Document 10: This document does not mention licensing"
