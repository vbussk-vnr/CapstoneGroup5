SPARKLINGSPRINGWATERHOLDINGSLTD_07_03_2002-EX-10.13-SOFTWARE LICENSE AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT__Volume Restriction,"Is there a fee increase or consent requirement, etc. if one party’s use of the product/services exceeds certain threshold?",0.2982456140350877,0.07017543859649122,0.23529411764705882,1.0,"Based on the provided context documents, there is no direct information about a fee increase or consent requirement if one party's use of the product/services exceeds a certain threshold. However, Document 5 provides some information related to price changes and audits.

Document 5 mentions a review process for price changes under Section 3.2, but it does not specify a threshold for exceeding usage. It only provides a process for reviewing price changes if customer requests it in writing within a certain timeframe.

However, Document 3 mentions ""Conversion Cost Markup"" which is calculated as 10% of the product of Manufacturer's Standard Conversion Cost for a Product for a Fiscal Year and the quantity of such Product ordered by Customer for delivery during such Fiscal Year. This implies that the cost may increase as the quantity of the product ordered by the customer increases, but it does not directly answer the question about a fee increase or consent requirement if one party's use of the product/services exceeds a certain threshold.

Therefore, based on the available information, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question."

In other words, this provision seems to acknowledge the possibility of competition but does not impose any restrictions on it."
