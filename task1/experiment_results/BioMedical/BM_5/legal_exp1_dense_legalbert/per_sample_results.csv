SPARKLINGSPRINGWATERHOLDINGSLTD_07_03_2002-EX-10.13-SOFTWARE LICENSE AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT__Volume Restriction,"Is there a fee increase or consent requirement, etc. if one party’s use of the product/services exceeds certain threshold?",0.16176470588235295,0.16176470588235295,1.0,0.0,"Based on the provided context documents, there is no direct information about a fee increase or consent requirement due to a party's use exceeding a certain threshold. However, Document 5 does mention a ""Conversion Cost Markup"" which is calculated as 10% of the product of Manufacturer's Standard Conversion Cost and the quantity of the Product ordered by Customer for delivery during a Fiscal Year. This suggests that as the quantity of a Product increases, the Conversion Cost Markup also increases, potentially leading to a higher liability for the Manufacturer. However, this is not explicitly stated as a fee increase or a consent requirement, but rather as a calculation for determining the Manufacturer's liability in the event of a Triggering Event."

However, there is a clause in Document 1 (Section 4.2.3.2.1) that provides for exclusive ownership of certain intellectual property rights by Skype, and another clause in Document 1 (Section 4.2.3.2.2) that provides for exclusive ownership of certain other intellectual property rights by Online BVI.

There is a clause in Document 3 (Section 4.7) stating that the parties agree to certain other rights to software source code, object code, and documentation, and trademarks and service marks related thereto, as described on Exhibit M, but it does not provide for joint or shared ownership.

Therefore, based on the provided context documents, it does not appear that there is a clause that provides for joint or shared ownership of intellectual property between the parties to the contract."
