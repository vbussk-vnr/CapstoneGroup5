SPARKLINGSPRINGWATERHOLDINGSLTD_07_03_2002-EX-10.13-SOFTWARE LICENSE AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT__Volume Restriction,"Is there a fee increase or consent requirement, etc. if one party’s use of the product/services exceeds certain threshold?",0.5772357723577236,0.5609756097560976,1.0,0.0,"Based on the provided context documents, there is a provision related to a possible fee increase or consent requirement if one party's use of the product/services exceeds certain thresholds.

In Document 10, Section 5.1.4, subsection (iii), it mentions that if a party exceeds its respective Overhead MIPS for any year, it shall bear the full cost and expense of upgrading the CPU-Based Software licenses. However, if the other party exceeds its Overhead MIPS, it shall pay the CPU Triggering Party an amount equal to the total cost to the CPU Triggering Party of purchasing the upgrade multiplied by a fraction.

This suggests that there is a cost associated with exceeding the specified threshold, and it appears to be a mechanism for cost allocation rather than a fee increase or consent requirement per se. However, without more information, it is difficult to determine the specifics of the allocation.

Document 3 also mentions that any termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to the settlement of the rights created and obligations incurred hereunder prior to the time of such termination. However, this does not appear to be directly related to a fee increase or consent requirement.

Document 9, Section 10.4, limits the liability of the parties and states that neither party's aggregate liability to the other"

Document 1 has a ""RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL"" clause, where Affiliate is required to notify Network 1 of any Bona Fide Offer to purchase or acquire Affiliate, and Network 1 has the exclusive right of first refusal to purchase or acquire on the same terms and conditions.

Document 2 has a ""right of first offer"" clause, where Hyatt's affiliate or Playa's affiliate has the right of first offer to acquire a Development Property, but this right expires if they fail to acquire the property within a specified period.

There are no clauses specifically granting a right of first negotiation to purchase, license, market, or distribute equity interest, technology, assets, products, or services.

However, there are several instances where one party has the right to approve or consent to the actions of the other party, which can be seen as a form of right of first refusal or right of first offer.
