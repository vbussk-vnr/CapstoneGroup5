SPARKLINGSPRINGWATERHOLDINGSLTD_07_03_2002-EX-10.13-SOFTWARE LICENSE AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT__Volume Restriction,"Is there a fee increase or consent requirement, etc. if one party’s use of the product/services exceeds certain threshold?",0.6842105263157895,0.05263157894736842,0.07692307692307693,0.0,"Based on the provided context documents, I can provide the following information.

Document 3 states that if the aggregate Price calculated by the accounting firm is: 

- Less than 95% of the aggregate Price established by Manufacturer, Manufacturer shall refund to Customer the overpayment made by Customer.
- More than 105% of the aggregate Price established by Manufacturer, Customer shall promptly pay Manufacturer for the amount of the underpayment that should have been paid by Customer.

This information suggests that if one party's use of the product/services exceeds a certain threshold (in this case, 95% or 105% of the established Price), there may be a fee increase or payment adjustment required. However, the context does not indicate that there is a requirement for consent from the other party in this situation."

Document 2 mentions a right of first refusal, where Pretzel Time is granted the right to purchase the business from Franchisee, subject to certain conditions. Document 1 mentions a right of first offer for a Development Opportunity, where one party has the option to purchase a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort property. 

Document 1 also mentions a right of first negotiation for a management agreement or franchise agreement, depending on which party exercises its right of first offer. However, these are more related to operational agreements rather than purchasing, licensing, marketing, or distributing equity interest, technology, assets, products, or services.

Document 4 mentions the right to sublicense or assign rights under an agreement, but this is more related to licensing and sublicensing rather than a right of first refusal or offer.

In summary, while there are clauses related to right of first refusal, right of first offer, and right of first negotiation, they are not exactly about purchasing, licensing, marketing, or distributing equity interest, technology,"

- Document 5 also mentions a 12-month warranty period.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services is at least 12 months, as stated in Documents 1, 2, and 5."
