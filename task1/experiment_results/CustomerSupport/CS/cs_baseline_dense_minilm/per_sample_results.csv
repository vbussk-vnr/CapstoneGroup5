You should use conversation sharing in DataPower MQ queue managers in the following situations:

- When you want to use IBM WebSphere MQ V7 and later release features such as Administrator stop-quiesce, Heartbeating, Read ahead, and Client asynchronous consume. 
- When you want to use the new buffer management feature of IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 when making MQGET API calls.

- When you want to support 2 or more conversations per TCP/IP channel instance.

There are special values on DataPower when configuring conversation sharing:

- The default setting of sharing conversations (SHARECNV) value is zero in DataPower mq-qm object. The same default value for MQ SVRCONN channel is 10. The sharing conversations value is negotiated between MQ server and DataPower and the lower value takes effect.

2.  Configure the Web Server plugin to accept SSL communications. You can find the instructions in the following URL: http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r5/topic/com.ibm.websphere.express.doc/ae/tsec_httpserv2.html
3.  Once the Web Server plugin is properly configured for SSL, restart your Apache HTTP Server and review the http_plugin.log file to confirm the following messages no longer appear in the log.

If the Web Server plug-in key database (plugin-key.kdb) does not exist in the location specified in the plugin-cfg.xml file being used by the IBM HTTP Server, then you might be able to implement the ""UseInsecure=true"" custom plug-in property to your web server definition to resolve your issue.

techqa_DEV_Q304,Does IBM DataPower Gateway Appliance support the HTTP CONNECT method? Does IBM DataPower Gateway Appliance support the HTTP CONNECT method for SSL proxy requests? ,0.34375,0.125,0.36363636363636365,1.0,"Based on the provided context documents, we can answer the question as follows:

From Document 1, we can see that the XML Firewall service on the IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance is not designed to use the CONNECT method for SSL tunneling. However, the Multi-Protocol Gateway (MPGW) does support the CONNECT method for SSL proxy requests when configuring in a User Agent's HTTP Proxy Policy.

From Document 5, we can see that there is a known issue (APAR IT16244) where the DataPower service (i.e. MPGW, WSP, etc) configured to connect to a backend server through an HTTP Proxy server using the HTTP CONNECT method might issue an SSL error when the proxy server receives a 5xx response. This suggests that the DataPower Gateway Appliance does support the HTTP CONNECT method for proxy requests, but may have issues handling certain error responses.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

Yes, IBM DataPower Gateway Appliance supports the HTTP CONNECT method for proxy requests, and also for SSL proxy requests when using the Multi-Protocol Gateway (MPGW) service. However, there may be issues handling certain error responses, as described in APAR IT16244."

According to Document 1, ""Remote users that access Datacap over a WAN can use Taskmaster Web-based 'thin clients', or FastDoc Capture operating in offline mode.""

However, Document 1 also states that ""Datacap thick clients (DotScan, DotEdit) and utilities (NENU, Fingerprint Maintenance Tool) require LAN communication speeds and low latency for responsive performance.""

techqa_DEV_Q016,"How to configure DC to look on a different App server for the SSP? 

I have a single Application server with the RES console installed, and then a separate application server with the XU, the ssp ear, etc. on that one. Each app server is configured separately with respective ports. for example, mgmt server (with the RES console only) has port 8000, and the runtime server (with all of the runtime components) has port 9000.

The problem I am running into is the following:

When I am trying to run a DVS test suite from Decision Center against RES, (my server endpoint in Decision Center is configured as http://hostname:port/res)

I am getting a ""the host and port are responsive but the ""/testing/sspService"" cannot be found. This is expected if it is looking on the same server as the RES console since the application (ssp) is not deployed there.

However, I cannot seem to configure the RES console to not assume that the ssp is running on the same port.",0.17777777777777778,0.06666666666666667,0.375,0.0,"Based on the information provided in the context documents, the issue you're facing is due to the RES console assuming that the SSP is running on the same server as the RES console. To configure DC to look for the SSP on a different App server, you need to create your own SSP resolver.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Create a new Java class that implements the `IlrSSPResolver` interface. In this class, you'll implement the `getSSPURL` method, which will return the URL of the SSP server.
2. In the `getSSPURL` method, use the `serverName` parameter to determine which server to point to. You can use a simple if-else statement to check the server name and return the corresponding URL.
3. In the example provided in Document 1, the `getSSPURL` method is implemented as follows:

```java
if (serverName.equals(""testingServer1"")) {
    return new URL(""http://server1:9080/testing"");
} else if (serverName.equals(""testingServer2"")) {
    return new URL(""http://server2:9080/testing"");
} else {
    return new URL(""http://host1:9080/testing"");

In Document 3, it's mentioned that Security Domains can be scoped to an entire cell, or to a specific set of servers, clusters, or service integration buses. Similarly, in Document 2, it's mentioned that JNDI bindings can be specified at different scopes, such as the cell, cluster, or application level.

In Document 1, it's mentioned that specifying a ""Naming Context"" value in the Service Definition that spans multiple subparts of the directory can cause issues. However, this is related to a specific LDAP configuration issue and is not directly applicable to your scenario.

To resolve the ADMA8019E error, you should ensure that the resources assigned to the application are within the deployment target scope. In your case, since the application is being deployed at the cluster scope, the resources should be defined at the cell, cluster, or application level.

It seems that the payload is getting truncated when I try to record custom logs to it using log-action. Why is this? How can I workaround it. ,0.3055555555555556,0.027777777777777776,0.09090909090909091,0.0,"Based on the provided context documents, the answer to the question is:

When using syslog-TCP log target on a DataPower Gateway, there is a limitation on the size of the payload that can be sent to the remote syslog server. The payload is getting truncated when it exceeds the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) of the network. The MTU for TCP is typically 1500 bytes.

To work around this limitation, you can consider the following options:

1. Use syslog-UDP instead of syslog-TCP. Syslog-UDP has a higher MTU, but it does not guarantee delivery of the log messages.
2. Increase the MTU of the network interface. However, this may not be possible or practical in all cases.
3. Use a log aggregation tool that can handle large payloads and reassemble them on the receiver side.
4. Use a custom logging solution that is designed to handle large payloads and does not rely on syslog.

It is also worth noting that the DataPower Gateway has a built-in logging mechanism that can handle large payloads. You can consider using this mechanism instead of syslog-TCP.

I have tried JOBTASK.DESCRIPTION.DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRITION and other combinations but they do not seem to work. ,0.21428571428571427,0.09523809523809523,0.4444444444444444,1.0,"Based on the provided context, I can help you with the query. However, it seems that the issue is not with the query itself but rather with the field name.

From the context, we can see that in the first scenario, the long description is accessed using the following query:

```sql
SELECT LDTEXT FROM LONGDESCRIPTION 
WHERE ldownertable = 'JOBTASK' and ldownercol = 'DESCRIPTION' 
AND LDKEY IN (
select jobtask.JOBTASKID
from jobtask
where jobtask.jobplanid= 51)
```

In the second scenario, the long description is accessed using the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM LONGDESCRIPTION 
WHERE ldownertable = 'PLUSCDSINSTR' and ldownercol = 'DESCRIPTION' 
AND LDKEY IN (
select pluscdsinstr.pluscdsinstrID
from pluscdsinstr
where
DSPLANNUM ='NEWDS' AND REVISIONNUM='0' AND HASLD=1 AND ASSETFUNCTION=10)

As you can see, the field name used in both queries is `DESCRIPTION`, not `DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRITION`.

The correct field name for the long description is likely `DESCRIPTION_LONG"

To resolve the issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check for deadlocks: Review the SystemOut.log file for messages related to hung threads or thread starvation. 
2. Check the group replication lock: The messages in the SystemOut.log file suggest that the system is waiting for the group replication lock to be released. This could be the cause of the hang.
3. Check the thread pool size: The WSVR0605W message suggests that there may be an issue with the thread pool size. Check the thread pool size and adjust it if necessary.
4. Restart the application server: Try restarting the application server to see if it resolves the issue.

However, without more information about the specific environment and configuration, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution. 

It is worth noting that Document 1 and Document 5 are similar in nature. Document 1 is related to starting a new process instance, while Document 5 is related to connecting to a P8 Content Engine. However, both documents mention hung threads and thread starvation, which could be related to the issue described in the question.

According to Document 2: DASHL2; session; time-out; timeout; cannot login; locked out ; 2147483647; security.xml TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING), setting the timeout parameter in the security.xml file to 2147483647 causes users to be locked out completely from DASH sessions. This is because the timeout value of 2147483647 is the maximum positive value for a 32-bit signed binary integer in computing, which is causing the condition that prevents a login.

To resolve this issue, you can follow the steps provided in Document 2 to set the custom property LTPAFIX in the consoleProperties.xml to ""false"". This will avert the condition that prevents logins when the timeout value is really big."

```bash
rm -rf /home/user/.eclipse/RationalFunctionalTester_8.2_????/

* `.metadata/.log`
* `.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/`
* `.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator/bundles.info`
