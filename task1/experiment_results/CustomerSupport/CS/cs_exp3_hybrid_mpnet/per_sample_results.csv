1. Set the Minimum connections to 0 on the data source to avoid situations where a connection is kept in the pool to meet the minimum requirement, even though it may have been idle for longer than Unused timeout. 
2. Set the values for Unused timeout and Reap timeout so that the sum does not exceed any network level idle connection timeout.

This can be achieved by:

* Going to Resources -> JDBC -> Data sources in the WAS admin console
* Selecting the Connection pools link and editing the Minimum connection folder for each of the 6 db domains
* Restarting the servers after the changes are made

To export a private key from DataPower Gateway Appliance:

You can use the `crypto-export` command. However, the `crypto-export` command requires various conditions to be met:

1. HSMs must be initialized and in the same key sharing domain on exporting and importing machines.
2. The private key in question must be marked exportable at keygen time (see `keygen`'s `exportable` option).
3. HSMs on exporting and importing machines must share internal key-wrapping keys (see `hsm-clone-kwk` command).

To move exported keys from one appliance to another, all the steps in the section must be followed, including synchronizing the key-wrapping keys using the `hsm-clone-kwk` command.

You should use conversation sharing in DataPower MQ queue managers in the following situations:

1. When the negotiated sharing conversations value is 1, as in Case #2. This is when the channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ V7 and later release features, but each TCP/IP channel instance has a single conversation.
2. When the negotiated sharing conversations value is 2 or more, as in Case #3. This is when the channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ 7 and later release features and each TCP/IP channel instance supports 2 or more conversations.
3. When using a value of 10 or less in Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object and verifying the configuration empirically to make sure that IBM WebSphere MQ server can sustain load from DataPower with the negotiated Sharing Conversations of 10.

However, for DataPower firmware releases 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier, you should follow Case #1 and use a negotiated sharing conversations value of 0.

In Document 2, it is mentioned that a static route forces the DataPower appliance to use a specific interface and a specific set of network hops to access a given set of destinations. It's possible that there is a static route configured on the DataPower appliance that is routing traffic from Domain A to MPGW_B in Domain B, even though FSH_B is disabled.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can check the static routes configured on the DataPower appliance using the command `xs40# show route`.

The change from using Update Installer to Installation Manager for installing fixpacks occurred in WebSphere version 7.0.0.0 or later, specifically with the release of IHS version 8.0.0.0. According to Document 5, prior to the use of Installation Manager, the fixpacks for IHS (V7 and V6.x) did not include files expected to be customized, such as default static content files like index.html, and the admin.passwd file.

The Installation Manager supports installation directly to a fixpack level, which is why all install files included with the base GA code 8.0.0.0 are applied with the fixpack. This change is also reflected in Document 4, where a note is added to the topic ""Installing IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition Version 7.0 using the command line"" to remind the reader that when using the imcl command to install the offering, the <installationDirectory> option needs to specify the appropriate WebSphere Application Server installation path.

To improve the performance of DVS testing and the Decision Warehouse, reduce the size of the execution trace data generated during tests, and consider some architectural and environmental configurations suited to your use case. The following are recommendations you can consider incorporating:

For DVS testing:

1. Filter data using the ruleset properties: monitoring.filters and monitoring.inout.filters.
2. Reduce the BOM serialization overhead:
   * Override the toString() method for the ruleset parameters to return minimal information.
   * Set the ruleset property ruleset.bom.enabled to ""false"" to remove support for BOM based serialization.
3. Reduce the number of columns in the Excel files by using the Ignore for DVS flag for the arguments in the DVS constructor, in Rule Studio or Rule Designer.
4. Choose not to write the traces to a database (Decision Warehouse) as shown in this sample.

For Decision Warehouse:

1. Manage the production and test environments separately and use a different Decision Warehouse instance for each environment.
2. Write asynchronously to Decision Warehouse:

",0.475,0.075,0.15789473684210525,0.0,"Based on the information provided in the context documents, I cannot find any direct information about an ADMA8019E error or a scenario where an application deployment throws this error due to namespace bindings defined at the cell scope. However, I can provide a possible explanation based on the general principles of WebSphere Application Server.

The error message suggests that the resources assigned to the application are beyond the deployment target scope. When deploying an application at the cluster scope, the resources (such as namespace bindings) should be defined at the cell, cluster, or application level.

In your case, since the namespace bindings are defined at the cell scope, it is possible that this is causing the ADMA8019E error. However, the fact that you don't see any issues with the JNDI lookup once the application is deployed suggests that the namespace bindings are indeed being resolved correctly.

To resolve this issue, you can try one of the following:

1. Check the documentation for your specific application to see if it has any specific requirements for namespace bindings.
2. Verify that the namespace bindings are correctly defined at the cell scope.
3. Consider redefining the namespace bindings at the cluster scope to match the deployment target scope.

The reason for this issue is due to the MQ client application trying to connect to a remote queue manager that does not have the MQ AMS (Advanced Message Security) component installed.

When the MQ client application is trying to connect to the remote queue manager, it is expecting to find the SYSTEM.PROTECTION.POLICY.QUEUE, which is a queue that is created by the MQ AMS component. However, since the remote queue manager does not have the MQ AMS component installed, this queue is not created, resulting in the error AMQ9050.

To resolve this issue, you need to either install the MQ AMS component on the remote queue manager or configure the MQ client application to not use the SYSTEM.PROTECTION.POLICY.QUEUE.

Alternatively, you can use the MQ V8 classes for JMS/Java, as mentioned in Document 3, which do not require the MQ AMS component to be installed on the remote queue manager."

techqa_DEV_Q033,Limitations of sylog-TCP log target using DataPower Gateways I am trying to configure a log target using type syslog-TCP. It seems that the payload is getting truncated when I try to record custom logs to it using log-action. Why is this? How can I workaround it. ,0.2719298245614035,0.2719298245614035,1.0,0.0,"Based on the provided context, the limitation of syslog-TCP log target using DataPower Gateways is that the payload is getting truncated when recording custom logs to it using log-action.

This is because the syslog protocol operates over UDP, which has no guarantee on packet delivery, and is a fast ""fire and forget"" method. This can lead to truncation of the payload if it exceeds a certain size.

To workaround this limitation, you can consider using other log target types, such as:

1. Syslog-ng: This operates over the TCP protocol, which ensures packet delivery and reduces the likelihood of truncation.
2. NFS: This allows for a more reliable method of logging, but is limited by network speed and NFS server response time.
3. File type: This allows log events to be quickly written to a local file on the device's file system, and then uploaded to a destination when the file reaches its set size.
4. HTTP service: This allows for a client browser or wget type client to easily retrieve the log file from the device, even in scenarios where local or remote log storage is not accessible.

You can choose the best method for your scenario based on the specific requirements and constraints of your environment."

techqa_DEV_Q184,"Why am I seeing ""CWSXM0100E: Multiple replies have been produced for a single request flow in module"" ? We are building a simple mediation module, consisting only of the request flow. The mediation module has one service invoke calling an external service through web service binding. Upon testing the process, we observe see that the service invoke is being called twice. There is no Fan-in or fan -out in the request flow. Below is the error: ""Caused by: com.ibm.wsspi.sibx.mediation.flow.MediationRuntimeException: CWSXM1023E: Exception when calling flow action: CWSXM0100E: Multiple replies have been produced for a single request flow in module"" ",0.5529411764705883,0.38823529411764707,0.7021276595744681,0.0,"Based on the provided context documents, the answer to the question is:

This issue is known as the ""Fan-out"" problem in Mediation Flows. Even though you have not explicitly added a Fan-out primitive to your request flow, the service invoke to the external service is causing a fan-out, which results in multiple replies being produced for a single request flow.

This is likely due to the fact that the external service you are invoking is returning multiple responses, and the Mediation Flow is not configured to handle this scenario correctly. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following:

1. Check the external service to see if it is returning multiple responses. If this is the case, you may need to modify the external service to return a single response.
2. If the external service is returning multiple responses and you cannot modify it, you can add a primitive to your request flow to handle the multiple responses correctly.
3. Alternatively, you can also try to configure the Mediation Flow to handle the multiple responses by adding a primitive such as a ""Choice"" primitive to determine which response to process.

It's worth noting that this issue is similar to APAR IC66137, which is mentioned in Document 1. However, the exact solution may vary depending on the"

This property no longer exists for the corrupted datatypes"".
",0.22916666666666666,0.22916666666666666,1.0,1.0,"Based on the provided context documents, it appears that the issue with corrupt DataTypes after Impact cluster failover/failback is related to the USERPARAMETERS property.

The solution is mentioned in Document 3, where it is stated that a new property needs to be added to increase the file size limit to handle large character lengths for the USERPARAMETERS parameter.

To resolve the issue, the following steps need to be taken:

1. Add the property to $NCHOME/impact/etc/<SERVERNAME>_server.props file with a value such as 8192, 16384, 32768, etc.
2. Ensure that the property is added to all ImpactServers in the Cluster.
3. Restart the ImpactServer to enable the new property.
4. Ensure that there are no trailing white-space characters on the property, as these can invalidate properties in lower versions of Impact.

Additionally, Document 5 provides a troubleshooting tip for a similar issue, where the PolicyList file was corrupted with missing entries and missing properties for the existing entries. However, in this case, the issue is specifically related to the USERPARAMETERS property."

This document explains that when an admin installs an Eclipse-based package and a non-admin uses it, the previous Eclipse configuration cruft is left behind in the user's .eclipse/ folder, which can cause issues with the correct functioning of the currently installed package(s).

The symptoms described in the problem (RFT not launching, log file showing a ClassNotFoundException for org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter) match the symptoms described in Document 5.

To resolve this issue, you can try the WORKAROUND described in Document 5:

Is there a best practice to refresh the WSP if I modified my WSDL?",0.4666666666666667,0.2222222222222222,0.47619047619047616,0.0,"To refresh a DataPower Web Service Proxy (WSP) when the underlying WSDL file has changed, you can refer to the following steps:

1. **Temporary Fix:**
   If you have made changes to a WSDL stored in the DataPower local filesystem and you want to reflect these changes in the WSP, you can disable and re-enable the WSP service. This will effectively refresh the WSDL cache and apply the changes.

2. **Permanent Fix:**
   If you are using a DataPower Gateway version 7.1.0 or later, you can no longer find the ""Refresh"" button in the WSP WebGUI as stated in the problem. However, according to Document 3, a known problem is that the WSDL Cache Policy does not apply to WSDLs hosted on the DataPower appliance, such as in local:///.

   To refresh a WSDL in the local:/// directory, you can use the steps mentioned in the problem:
   - Disable the WSP service.
   - Re-enable the WSP service.
