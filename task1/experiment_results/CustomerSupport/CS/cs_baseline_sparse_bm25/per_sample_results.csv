Based on the troubleshooting steps in Document 1, the issue with images not being displayed in PDF/Excel format in Cognos Analytics 11.0.3 might be due to incorrect permissions on the folder containing the image, the image not being within the specified directory, or the directory not existing in the specified location. 

You can try the troubleshooting steps outlined in Document 1, which involve using Process Monitor and checking the image accessibility in the report. If the issue persists, you may need to investigate further and potentially seek help from IBM Cognos support."

To avoid the exception while requesting from Decision Center the execution of a scenario suite on Scenario Service Provider (SSP) over HTTPS, you need to configure the truststore of the machine hosting the Scenario Service Provider (SSP) to trust the certificate of the Decision Center server.

Here is the procedure to follow:

1.  Download the certificate of the Decision Center server (the server that will be calling the Scenario Service Provider (SSP) over HTTPS).
2.  Import the certificate into the truststore of the machine hosting the Scenario Service Provider (SSP). The truststore is typically located at `$WAS_HOME/lib/bootstrap/java/cacerts`.
3.  Restart the Scenario Service Provider (SSP) server.

Alternatively, you can also configure the Scenario Service Provider (SSP) to use a different truststore that trusts the certificate of the Decision Center server.

Also, note that the certificates used for the Scenario Service Provider (SSP) and Decision Center must be trusted by all the machines in the collective."

In your case, even though FSH_B is disabled, the DataPower appliance is still randomly picking it as the default route for some traffic. This is causing traffic to go to MPGW_B.

However, based on the information provided, I can suggest a few possible sources that may contain the answer:

1. The product documentation for IIB and WMB may contain information about the files created during startup.
2. The mqsicreatebar command, which is used to create a BAR file, may create temporary files in the $TEMP directory.
3. The mqsidc tool, which is used to collect diagnostic data, may also create temporary files in the $TEMP directory.

To answer the question, I would recommend checking the product documentation or searching for related technical notes or knowledge center articles that may provide more information about the files created during startup of IIB or WMB.

Alternatively, if you have access to the IIB or WMB logs or configuration files, you may be able to determine the location and names of the files created during startup.

The SSH connections fail after the upgrade to v7.5.2 and above because the OpenSSH version on the IBM i has been upgraded from 6.6p1 to 6.9p1. In OpenSSH 6.7 and subsequent releases, the default set of ciphers, MACs, and kex algorithms has been changed to remove unsafe algorithms. If the partner SSH server or client is running an old version of OpenSSH that does not support the new default algorithms, the connections will fail.

To resolve the issue, you can either upgrade the SSH client/server to a version that supports the new default algorithms or modify the OpenSSH configuration file on the IBM i to add back in the unsafe algorithms required to have the client connect."

techqa_DEV_Q016,"How to configure DC to look on a different App server for the SSP? 

I have a single Application server with the RES console installed, and then a separate application server with the XU, the ssp ear, etc. on that one. Each app server is configured separately with respective ports. for example, mgmt server (with the RES console only) has port 8000, and the runtime server (with all of the runtime components) has port 9000.

The problem I am running into is the following:

To configure the RES console to look for the SSP on a different application server, you need to specify the correct URL of the SSP in the RES console configuration.

According to Document 1, the problem is due to user errors in configuration, and one of the common mistakes is to specify the URL of the SSP server instead of the Rule Execution Server (RES) URL.

In your case, you have the RES console installed on one application server (mgmt server) with port 8000, and the SSP is deployed on a separate application server (runtime server) with port 9000.

To fix the issue, you need to update the RES console configuration to point to the correct URL of the SSP, which is on the runtime server with port 9000. You can do this by updating the 'Server endpoint' field in the Decision Center configuration to point to the correct URL of the SSP.

Since you have the SSP deployed on a separate application server with a different port, you need to specify the correct URL of the SSP in the format: http://"

1. What are the possible uses of IBM MQ clients?

According to Document 1, possible uses of IBM MQ clients include:

- Implementing IBM MQ messaging and queuing in an efficient way.
- Running an application on one machine and connecting to a queue manager on a different machine, either physical or virtual.
- Reducing hardware requirements on the client system.
- Reducing system administration requirements.
- Allowing an IBM MQ application to connect to multiple queue managers on different systems.
- Using alternative channels with different transmission protocols.

The detailed solution from Document 3 is as follows:

* The problem occurs when a global transaction fails with an error code of -911, and the xa_end and xa_rollback commands are executed.
* This causes the transaction to remain in the xa_transaction mode, and subsequent transactions fail with XAER_RMFAIL.
* The fix is to switch out of the xa_transaction during xa_failure when the transaction is due to a -911 error.
* This can be achieved by upgrading to DB2 UDB version 10.1 fix pack 2.

Therefore, the recommended solution is to upgrade to DB2 UDB version 10.1 fix pack 2 to resolve the XAER_RMFAIL messages in SystemOut.log."

Specifically, we should look at Document 1, which discusses configuring a log target using syslog-TCP on DataPower Gateways.

According to Document 1, the syslog protocol operates over UDP, which has no guarantee on packet delivery. This is referred to as a ""fast fire and forget method."" However, syslog-ng works over TCP, which ensures packet delivery to the destination.

In the section discussing syslog-ng, it is mentioned that the same consideration should be applied to a device under high load, as a log event could be dropped if not able to be written out to the network within time.

The section discussing file type log targets mentions that all NFS limitations apply, including file size and permission settings. This may be relevant if you are experiencing issues with log payload truncation due to storage limitations.

However, the section discussing HTTP service as a log target does not mention payload truncation.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state why the payload is getting truncated when using syslog-TCP as a log target.

According to Document 1, the problem is caused by a highly intermittent error that may allow the sensor reading mechanism to get into a bad state, generating false error messages. This bad state can be reset by rebooting the appliance.

To resolve the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the LED status on the power supplies. If the LED's are green, it indicates that the power supplies are working normally.
2. If the power supplies are not working normally, perform a reboot of the appliance to reset the sensors.

I have tried JOBTASK.DESCRIPTION.DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRITION and other combinations but they do not seem to work. ,0.16666666666666666,0.08333333333333333,0.5,0.0,"Based on the context documents, I can see that you're trying to modify the JP sheet to include the JOBTASK Long description in the query. 

From Document 1, we can see that the long description is stored in the LONGDESCRIPTION table, and the LDKEY is the key to get the long description. 

In Scenario 1, the query to get the long description is:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM LONGDESCRIPTION 
WHERE ldownertable = 'JOBTASK' and ldownercol = 'DESCRIPTION' 
AND LDKEY IN (
select jobtask.joBTASKID
from jobtask
where
jobtask.jobplanid= 51)

To modify the JP sheet to include the JOBTASK Long description, you can try the following query:
```sql
SELECT 
  JOBPLANID, 
  JOBTASK.DESCRIPTION, 
  LDTEXT 
FROM 
  JOBPLAN 
  JOIN JOBTASK ON JOBPLAN.JPNUM = JOBTASK.JPNUM

Based on the context provided, I couldn't find an exact match for this issue. However, Document 5 mentions a similar issue where a process instance starts hanging if it's called by a service attached to an undercover agent (UCA). The problem is caused by a limitation in the product.

To resolve this issue, the BPMN best practice should be used, which is to model the process with a start message event. The UCA is then attached to the start message event.

However, since this is not an exact match, I would recommend looking into the following possibilities:

1.  Configuration issues: Ensure that the configuration is correct and there are no issues with the group replication lock.
2.  Database issues: Check if there are any issues with the database connection or if the database is not responding.
3.  Resource constraints: Check if there are any resource constraints, such as memory or CPU issues, that could be causing the hang.

If none of these possibilities resolve the issue, it may be necessary to contact IBM Support for further assistance.

It's worth noting that there are a few other APARs in the provided context that mention issues with hung threads, such as:

However, I can try to provide a possible answer based on the information available.

Document 2 mentions that setting LTPA timeout value to 2147483647 in security.xml may cause FireFox and IE to prompt for authentication again after login. 

Document 1 also mentions that setting the timeout parameter in the security.xml file to 2147483647 causes a condition that prevents a login, if the timeout value is really big.

It seems that setting the timeout to such a large value causes issues with the login process.

However, it is also mentioned in Document 1 that this issue can be resolved by setting the custom property LTPAFIX in the consoleProperties.xml to ""false"".

Therefore, I would suggest checking the consoleProperties.xml file and setting the LTPAFIX property to ""false"" to resolve the issue with the users being unable to login to Web GUI 8.1 after modifying the timeout in the security.xml file.

Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation system that can handle high volumes of data. ITNM is a network management platform that uses Apache Storm for its processing engine.

The files you mentioned are likely related to the Storm process in ITNM. They appear to be temporary files used by the Storm workers for various purposes, such as:

- connlicj.bin: This file might be used for connection licensing or logging in the Storm worker.
- jccdiag.log: This file could be a log file for the Java Connection Client (JCC) diagnostics in the Storm worker.
- license.lock: This file might be related to the licensing mechanism of the Storm worker.
- serverlist.lock: This file could be a lock file used by the Storm worker to synchronize access to a server list or configuration.

When and why these files are generated is likely related to the specific configuration and usage of Apache Storm in ITNM. However, without more information about the specific ITNM configuration and the exact usage of Apache Storm in that"

Is there a best practice to refresh the WSP if I modified my WSDL?",0.4,0.15555555555555556,0.3888888888888889,0.0,"Based on the provided context documents, to refresh a DataPower Web Service Proxy (WSP) which WSDL got changed, you have two options:

1. Disable and re-enable the service: As mentioned in Document 1, when the WSDL file is located on the DataPower appliance under the ""local"" directory, the WSDL Cache Policy does not apply, and you need to disable and re-enable the service to refresh the WSP.

2. Increase the WSDL cache refresh interval: Although not directly mentioned in the context, it can be inferred from Document 5 that increasing the WSDL cache refresh interval can minimize how often the refreshes occur, thus reducing the number of times you need to disable and re-enable the service.

As for the best practice to refresh the WSP if you modified your WSDL, consider the following:

- If possible, make changes to the WSDL in a development environment and then deploy the updated WSDL to the production environment.
- If you need to make changes to the WSDL in production, make the changes and then disable and re-enable the WSP to refresh it.
- Consider creating a script or a process to automate the WSP refresh after making changes to the WSDL.
