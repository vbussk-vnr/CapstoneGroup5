To answer the question, I would need to know the actual content of Document 5. However, based on the information provided, I can try to provide a possible explanation for the issue.

If the FSH_B is disabled, it should not be able to accept traffic. However, if modifying the config for MPGW_B causes traffic to go to MPGW_B, it's possible that the change caused MPGW_B to be associated with a different security domain or scope, which is allowing it to receive traffic.

Another possible explanation is that the change caused the routing rules to be updated, allowing traffic to be routed to MPGW_B.

The change from using UpdateInstaller to install fixpacks to using Installation Manager occurred in WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0.

In previous versions of WebSphere (before version 7.0), fixpacks for the WebSphere Application Server and the JDK were separate and independent of each other. This meant that you would have to download and apply each fixpack separately.

Starting with WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0, the fixpacks for the WebSphere Application Server and the JDK are packaged together in a single package using Installation Manager. This change was made to simplify the installation and management of fixpacks.

Therefore, if you were using UpdateInstaller to install fixpacks in a previous version of WebSphere (before 7.0), you would have had to apply separate fixpacks for the WebSphere Application Server and the JDK. With Installation Manager, starting from version 7.0, you can install fixpacks for both the WebSphere Application Server and the JDK in a single package."

Document 3, APAR 772734, mentions that the Topic, Configuring port settings, is missing information about configuring to set port numbers in a different port range so that they cannot conflict. The resolution is to update the topic to add a third optional step that reads:

""Optional: Set port numbers in a different port range so that they cannot conflict. WebSphere Application Server cannot always detect port conflicts when multiple installations are present on multiple hosts. To set port numbers in this situation so that you avoid port conflicts, adjust the starting port numbers of each installation to be in a different range from the other installations.""

This suggests that the issue you are experiencing is due to a port number conflict, specifically with port number 6,002, which is outside of your specified port range of 7000/8000.

Why SSH connections fail after upgrade to v7.5.2 and above? The same configuration works on v7.2."" 

However, based on the information in Document 1, it seems that the issue might be related to the changes made to the default set of ciphers in OpenSSH 6.7 and subsequent releases. 

If the problem is related to the cipher changes, it could be related to one of the following:

1. The SSH client or server is older and does not support the safer ciphers and MACs used by default in OpenSSH 6.9p1.
2. The SSH client or server is not configured to use the compatible cipher, MAC, or kex algorithm.

To resolve the issue, refer to the troubleshooting steps in Document 1, which describe how to upgrade the SSH client or server, modify the OpenSSH configuration file, or add back in the unsafe algorithms required to have the client connect.

However, the provided context does not contain enough information to directly answer the question. But it does provide relevant information for the solution.

Document 3 (TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)) describes a similar issue, but it does not directly address ODM 8.8. 

However, the solution to the similar issue in Document 3 (TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)) can be applied to prevent rule execution failing because of recurrent StaleConnectionException on ODM 8.8 Rule Execution Server.

The solution involves configuring the WebSphere Application Server data source connection pool to eliminate occurrences of StaleConnectionException.

To do this, you would need to:

1. Set the Minimum connections to 0 to avoid situations where a connection is kept in the pool to meet the minimum requirement, even though it may have been idle for longer than Unused timeout.
2. Set the values for Unused timeout and Reap timeout so that the sum does not exceed any network level idle connection timeout.

This solution is based on the assumption that the underlying network connection for the data source is becoming invalid due to idle connection timeouts.

You can configure Decision Center (DC) to look for the SSP on a different application server by creating your own SSP resolver and deploying it on the server with the RES console.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Create your own SSP resolver class implementing `IlrSSPResolver` interface. This class will be responsible for determining the SSP URL based on the server name or other criteria.
2. In your SSP resolver class, implement the `getSSPURL(String serverName, URL url)` method to return the SSP URL for the desired server.
3. Package your SSP resolver class and deploy it on the server with the RES console (management server).
4. Update the `teamserver.defaultSSPResolver.class` property to point to your custom SSP resolver class.
5. Make sure the SSP (ssp.war) is deployed on the server with the XU, XOMs, and other runtime components (runtime server), along with a XU connection factory and the appropriate datasource definition.

By following these steps, you should be able to configure DC to look for the SSP on the separate application server.

However, the actual issue is not the JNDI lookup once the application is deployed, but rather the deployment process itself. The application is trying to deploy at the cluster scope, but it is referencing resources that are defined at the cell scope. This means that the application cannot be deployed successfully because it is trying to access resources that are outside of its deployment scope.

You should be concerned about this error because it prevents the application from being deployed successfully. To resolve this issue, you need to either:

1. Deploy the application at the cell scope, so that it can access the resources defined at the cell scope.
2. Move the resources (namespace bindings) that are defined at the cell scope to the cluster scope, so that they are within the deployment target scope of the application.
3. Use a different approach, such as using a different JNDI name or a different deployment target, that does not require the resources to be defined at the cell scope."

The error AMQ9050 regarding SYSTEM.PROTECTION.POLICY.QUEUE is caused by the fact that the MQ client application is trying to connect to a MQ server queue manager that does not have the MQ AMS (Advanced Message Security) component installed.

This issue is similar to the one described in Document 2, where the problem description states that an application using the WebSphere MQ v7.5 classes for JMS or classes for Java to connect to an IBM MQ v8 queue manager that has the Advanced Message Security component installed, will result in an error when opening a queue.

In this case, the MQ client application is trying to connect to a remote queue manager running MQ v7.0.1.x, which does not have the MQ AMS component installed. The MQ client application is expecting the MQ AMS functionality to be available, but it is not, resulting in the error AMQ9050.

It is worth noting that this issue is likely to be related to the fact that the MQ client application is using a higher version of the MQ classes (v8) than the queue manager it is trying to connect to (v7.0.1.x)."

Document 3 provides an example of how to identify and delete blank pages based on their size, but it doesn't explicitly address hiding pages based on their status.

However, a possible approach to hide a page based on its status could be to use a custom action in Datacap, similar to the example provided in Document 3. The action could check the page status and if it matches a certain condition (in this case, status 20), it could hide the page.

Here is a possible answer based on the example provided in Document 3:

""Use an action like BlankPagesIDByStatus to identify the page to be hidden: 

* BlankPagesIDByStatus (20, HideMe)

Then, create a rule with the action DeleteChildType(HideMe) and attach it at the batch level to have it remove all pages with page type HideMe. If building a custom action, the DeleteChild API method is invoked from the parent object.""

The error message you are observing:

[failure] Power supply '1' has no AC input power, or is not present. [failure] Power supply '2' has no AC input power, or is not present.

is due to the battery being disconnected from the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) as per Document 3, which states that uninterruptible power supplies might be shipped with the battery disconnected due to air-freight safety requirements.

To resolve this issue, you do not need to replace the power supplies. Instead, you need to reconnect the battery to the UPS as per the instructions in Document 3.

You should follow the steps to reconnect the batteries on uninterruptible power supplies that you are installing. If you are returning failed uninterruptible power supplies, you should reverse the procedure.

The symptoms of the issue are:

* JVM hangs during startup
* Hung threads are reported in the SystemOut.log file
* The following messages are logged: ""The system has been waiting for the group replication lock to be released for the last X minutes.""

The cause of the issue is likely due to a deadlock between two threads, one of which is waiting for a database lock and the other is waiting for a Java lock. This is similar to the issue described in Document 2, where a deadlock occurs between two threads performing an archive operation on the same snapshot.

To resolve this issue, an ifix (JR44560) has been implemented to prevent the deadlock from happening. The ifix can be downloaded from Fix Central, along with the README file for instructions on how to install and uninstall it.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

The BPM AppTarget startup hangs during startup due to a deadlock caused by two threads waiting on each other. An ifix (JR44560) has been implemented to prevent this deadlock from happening, and can be downloaded from Fix Central."
techqa_DEV_Q017,Can I perform a silent install of fix packs for IIB or WMB Toolkit? How do I perform a silent install of fix packs for IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) Toolkit?,0.7153284671532847,0.0364963503649635,0.05102040816326531,0.0,"Context: Question about silent install of fix packs for IIB or WMB Toolkit.

Please find the answer below.

Yes, you can perform a silent install of fix packs for IIB or WMB Toolkit.

Answer: 
To perform a silent install of fix packs for the IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) Toolkit, you can use the following command:

 msiexec /i <path_to_fixpack> /qn

Replace <path_to_fixpack> with the path to the fixpack .zip file.

However, the original question is asking about silent install of fix packs for IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) Toolkit, but the provided context does not contain enough information about this. Document 5 provides information on how to download fixpack repository images to upgrade WebSphere Application Server installations using IBM Installation Manager, but it does not have information about silent install of fix packs for IIB or WMB Toolkit.

However, Document 5 does provide a general method to install fix packs, but it does not specifically mention how to do it silently."

However, based on the information in Document 1, it seems that setting the session timeout to 2147483647 in the security.xml file can cause issues with the login process. 

In Document 1, it is stated that ""In order to maximize the time between session timeouts, the customer is setting the timeout parameter in the security.xml file to 2147483647."" However, this setting causes a condition that prevents a login.

In Document 2, it is mentioned that setting LTPA timeout value to 2147483647 in security.xml may cause FireFox and IE to prompt for authentication again after login. This suggests that the value 2147483647 may be causing issues with the authentication process.

Therefore, it is likely that the issue you are experiencing is related to the value you set in the security.xml file, but without more information, it is difficult to provide a specific answer."

techqa_DEV_Q154,"Why are some Datatypes corrupt after Impact cluster failover/failback ? 

Running Impact 7.1.0.11. The symptom is whenever Impact does a failover, a couple DataTypes

This property no longer exists for the corrupted datatypes"".

However, Document 5 provides a clue that the issue might be related to the property *.SQL.USERPARAMETERS.

In Document 5, it is mentioned that the property *.SQL.USERPARAMETERS is included in the character length for the USERPARAMETERS parameter, which has a file size limit. The APAR IZ81446 is related to the issue of replicating Datatypes with USERPARAMETERS values in excess of 16,000 characters.

It is likely that the corruption of some Datatypes after Impact cluster failover/failback is related to this issue, but the exact cause and solution are not explicitly stated in the provided context documents.

This issue is similar to the one described in Document 3, where an out-of-date Eclipse configuration is left behind in the user's .eclipse/ folder, causing the Eclipse platform to fail to launch.

To resolve this issue, you can try the same workaround mentioned in Document 3:

1. Delete the user's .eclipse/ folder.
2. Relaunch RFT 8.2.

Alternatively, you can try adding the required Eclipse configuration files to the correct location in the Eclipse configuration directory, as mentioned in Document 5.

However, since the issue is not explicitly mentioned in any of the provided documents, I would recommend trying these workarounds to see if they resolve the issue.

To refresh a DataPower Web Service Proxy (WSP) when the associated WSDL has changed, consider the following:

1. **Disable and re-enable the service**: According to Document 3, to refresh a WSDL in the local:/// directory, disable and re-enable the service. This is a straightforward method.
2. **Increase the WSDL cache refresh interval**: As mentioned in Document 1, you can minimize how often the WSDL cache refreshes occur by increasing the WSDL cache refresh interval. This might help reduce the frequency of refreshes, but it's not a direct solution to refresh the WSP.
3. **Use the ""Refresh"" button (if available)**: Although, as you mentioned, the ""Refresh"" button is not available in the DataPower Gateway 7.1.0 Web Service Proxy WebGUI, you can try checking if it's available in other versions or configurations.
4. **Create an additional WS-Proxy**: According to Document 4, creating additional WS-Proxies can reduce the number of WSDLs per proxy, which might help improve performance. However,"
