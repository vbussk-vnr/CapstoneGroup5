techqa_DEV_Q243,"Using cobol copybooks Sometimes, there will be errors/fields missing in typetree, while importing cobol copybooks. Is there any format for copybooks(specifically to be used in wtx), that we need to follow? ",0.1111111111111111,0.1111111111111111,1.0,0.0,"Based on the provided context documents, there is no direct information about the specific format for Cobol copybooks to be used in WTX. However, I can suggest a possible answer based on the information provided in Document 5.

In Document 5, the problem is related to the missing COBOL Copybook importer option after upgrading IBM WTX 8.4.1.0 to 8.4.1.1 on the Windows platform. The cause of the problem is that some files are not correctly overwritten/modified during the upgrade.

Although this document does not provide information about the format for Cobol copybooks, it suggests that the issue might be related to the installation process rather than the format of the copybooks themselves.

Therefore, my answer would be:

There is no specific format for Cobol copybooks that needs to be followed when using them in WTX, but there might be issues related to the installation process that need to be addressed.

However, I would like to note that the provided context documents do not provide a clear answer to this question."

CAUSE
When an IBM SPSS compressed image is launched, files compressed within it are extracted to the temporary location assigned to the signed in user i.e. /Documents and settings/... or /users.
The possibility of these files downloaded improperly exists. You can use a tool such
as MD5 to verify the file content or simply attempt downloading a second time and test.

- Available space within the temporary location noted by the installer.
- Ability to write in the temporary location noted by the installer.

How to configure the machines hosting the WebSphere Operational Decision Management modules with regard to HTTPS when executing scenario suites ?
How to avoid the exception below while requesting from Decision Center the execution of a scenario suite on Scenario Service Provider (SSP) over HTTPS ?

To configure the machines hosting the WebSphere Operational Decision Management modules with regard to HTTPS, you need to follow these steps:

1. Configure the Web Server plugin to accept SSL communications. The steps to do this are listed in Document 5. You can ignore step 1 since it is not needed on the IBM i.
2. Once the web server plugin is properly configured for SSL, restart your Apache HTTP Server and review the http_plugin.log file to confirm the following messages no longer appear in the log.
3. Make sure the Web Server plug-in key database (plugin-key.kdb) exists in the location specified in the plugin-cfg.xml file being used by the IBM HTTP Server.
4. If the Web Server plug-in key database (plugin-key.kdb) does not exist, you might be able to implement the ""UseInsecure=true"" custom plug-in property to your web server definition to resolve your issue.

The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that the port number you're trying to use (6020) is within the range of the default port settings, and there's a conflict with another installation on the system.

To resolve this issue, you can try the temporary fix suggested in Document 5, which is to set port numbers in a different port range so that they cannot conflict. This can be done by manually assigning a different port range in the second installation, as described in the document.

""Topic, Configuring port settings, is missing information about configuring to set port numbers in a different port range so that they cannot conflict.

Another possible cause could be related to the issue described in Document 1, where the problem occurs due to an old unfinished transaction clogging up the log. However, this seems less likely to be related to the JVMSERVER state.

To resolve the issue, I would recommend checking the zFS files and ensuring that they are properly propagated to the target environment. Additionally, verifying the JVM Server configuration and checking for any other potential issues related to the CICS region or JVM Server might be helpful.

SUMMARY
 IBM Tivoli/Security Directory Server (ITDS/ISDS) as a component of IBM Tivoli Network Performance Manager Wireless Platform are affected by a TLS padding vulnerability, which could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
The following vulnerability affects IBM Security Directory Server as a component of IBM Tivoli Network Performance Manager Wireless Platform

CVEID: CVE-2014-8730 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8730]

DESCRIPTION: IBM Security Directory Server could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to check the contents of the padding bytes when using CBC cipher suites of some TLS implementations. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) like attack to decrypt sensitive information and calculate the plaintext of secure connections.

To troubleshoot event issues, you can use a utility called tcpdump. tcpdump allows the administrator to define the interface, port, source or destination IP addresses for the syslog data being sent and writes the packet data on-screen to help users determine if events are received by QRadar.

Here are the steps:

1. Review the event source sending Syslog events and verify the IP address.
2. Use tcpdump to verify the syslog data is received by QRadar. The command for TCP Syslog is: `tcpdump -s 0 -A host Device_Address and port 514` and for UDP Syslog is: `tcpdump -s 0 -A host Device_Address and udp port 514`.
3. If you do not see any events in the command line, then it is likely that either the device is not sending Syslog events or there is a firewall blocking communication.

You can configure Decision Center (DC) to look for the SSP on a different application server by implementing a custom SSP resolver in your Rule Team Server (RTS). 

Here are the steps:

1.  Pack all your XOMs (eXecutable Object Model) into the ssp.war following the documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global720.html].

The error message ADMA8019E suggests that the application is trying to access resources that are not within the deployment target scope. This can happen when the namespace bindings are defined at a higher level (e.g., cell scope) and the application is deployed at a lower level (e.g., cluster scope).

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following:

1. Check the namespace bindings and make sure they are defined at the correct level. In this case, you mentioned that the namespace bindings are defined at the cell scope, which might be the cause of the issue.
2. Verify that the resources assigned to the application are within the deployment target scope. You can check the resource assignments in the administrative console to see if they are correct.
3. Consider redeploying the application with the correct namespace bindings and resource assignments to see if the issue is resolved.

According to Document 3, the problem description states that the Advanced Message Security (AMS) capability is included in the WebSphere MQ v7.5 (and later) classes for JMS and classes for Java. Since MQ v8 client has AMS capability, it will try to use it even if the remote queue manager does not have AMS installed, resulting in the error AMQ9050.

To resolve this issue, you can either:

1. Use IBM MQ V8 classes for JMS/Java (as mentioned in Document 3).
2. Use WMQ V7.5.0.4 classes for JMS, then disable the AMS function (as mentioned in Document 3).
3. Remove the AMS component from the queue manager installation if this is not required by the connecting applications.

However, Document 2 provides information about how to fix XAER_RMFAIL messages in DB2.

According to Document 2, the problem occurs when a global transaction is failed with XAER_RMFAIL, due to a lock timeout (-911 error). The fix is to switch out of the xa transaction during xa_failure when the transaction is due to -911 error.

To fix the issue, you can try the following:

* Upgrade to DB2 UDB to version 10.1 fix pack 2 (as mentioned in Document 2).

How can I workaround it. ,0.31313131313131315,0.1717171717171717,0.5483870967741935,1.0,"Based on the provided context documents, the answer to the question is as follows:

When using a syslog-TCP log target with DataPower Gateways, there is a limitation on the maximum payload size of 65535 bytes. This is because the syslog-TCP protocol operates over TCP, which has a maximum segment size (MSS) of 65535 bytes.

If you try to record custom logs that exceed this size, they will get truncated. To workaround this limitation, you can try one of the following methods:

1. Log the events in a file type log target using a backup method, as described in the document ""datapower; 7993; machine type 7993; logging; off device; off device logging; log target; off-device; syslog; debug log level; debug; log level TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)"".
2. Use an HTTP service to retrieve the log file, as described in the same document. This method is useful when there is no local or accessible remote log storage location to the device, due to firewall or network restrictions.
3. Use a different log target type, such as NFS or file type, which may have different limitations and configurations.

techqa_DEV_Q184,"Why am I seeing ""CWSXM0100E: Multiple replies have been produced for a single request flow in module"" ? We are building a simple mediation module, consisting only of the request flow. The mediation module has one service invoke calling an external service through web service binding. Upon testing the process, we observe see that the service invoke is being called twice. There is no Fan-in or fan -out in the request flow. Below is the error: ""Caused by: com.ibm.wsspi.sibx.mediation.flow.MediationRuntimeException: CWSXM1023E: Exception when calling flow action: CWSXM0100E: Multiple replies have been produced for a single request flow in module"" ",0.575,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Unfortunately, the provided context documents do not directly address the specific issue you are experiencing with the ""CWSXM0100E: Multiple replies have been produced for a single request flow in module"" error.

However, based on the information in Document 4, it appears to be a similar issue related to the automatic conversion of interface maps to mediation flows. The issue mentioned in Document 4 is related to the mediation flow failing due to the display names of business object maps in the request and response flows differing, which is causing the mediation to produce multiple replies.

However, in your case, you are building a simple mediation module with only a request flow and a service invoke calling an external service through a web service binding. There is no fan-in or fan-out in the request flow.

Since the context documents do not provide a direct solution to your problem, I would recommend checking the following:

1. Verify that the service invoke is properly configured and not calling the external service twice.
2. Check the mediation flow configuration to ensure that there are no unintended loops or recursive calls.
3. Review the logs to see if there are any other errors or warnings that might be related to the issue.
4. Consider reaching out to IBM support or consulting the official IBM documentation for further assistance."

The error message indicates that the system has been waiting for the group replication lock to be released for an extended period of time, which suggests that there is a deadlock or a lock contention issue.

The stack trace indicates that the `getAllGroups()` method is being called repeatedly, which is causing the JVM to hang.

A possible solution to this issue is to investigate and resolve the lock contention issue. This may involve analyzing the database logs to determine which transaction is holding the lock, and then taking steps to resolve the issue.

In Document 3, a similar issue is described where hung threads can be seen in the java core dump files, one surrounding the synchronized block of ServerImpl.getContainerCapability() and the other surrounding BaseActionsImpl.getRepositoryState(). The issue was resolved by implementing a mechanism to prevent the deadlock from happening.

In Document 4, a similar issue is described where the process creation might hang, and the SystemOut.log file shows a hung thread exception for a thread holding a database connection. The issue was resolved by using the BPMN best practice, which is to model the process with a"

However, Document 4 provides instructions on how to download and install a fix pack for IBM Packaging Utility, which is used to generate a new repository for packages, copy packages to a new repository, and delete packages that are no longer needed.

It is likely that the fix pack installation process for IIB or WMB Toolkit may be similar to the process described in Document 4. To determine the correct process, you may need to refer to the specific documentation for the IIB or WMB Toolkit that you are using.

However, Document 5 provides a link to the IBM Software Support Handbook, which may contain information on how to perform a silent install of fix packs for IIB or WMB Toolkit.

To perform a silent install of fix packs for IIB or WMB Toolkit, you may need to follow these general steps:

1. Download the fix pack from the IBM website.

In Document 4, there's another TECHNOTE that mentions the same issue with the timeout value 2147483647.

However, the document does not mention anything about Web GUI 8.1. 

Document 1 and Document 4 are the only ones that mention the issue with the timeout value 2147483647, but they do not provide any information about Web GUI 8.1.

Therefore, the answer is based on the assumption that the issue is the same as the one described in Document 1 and Document 4. 

The users are unable to login to Web GUI 8.1 after modifying the timeout to 2147483647 in the security.xml file because this large number is equivalent to 4085 years, and it's not a reasonable or practical timeout value. 

Instead, users should use a reasonable and practical timeout value as suggested in the documents.

The resolution for this issue is to add a new property to increase the file size limit in the $NCHOME/impact/etc/<SERVERNAME>_server.props file. This property should be added to all ImpactServers in the Cluster and requires a restart to enable. The property should be added with a value such as 8192, 16384, 32768, etc. to handle a large character length for the USERPARAMETERS parameter.

The character length includes the whole USERPARAMETERS property name as well as the definition. For example, one would add the property:

According to Document 4, ""datapower; wsdl cache refresh; wsdl; cache; refresh TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)"", the DataPower device will not poll WSDL files on the local store. Therefore, the WSDL Cache policy will not apply to WSDL files hosted on the local store.

To refresh the WSP, you need to disable and re-enable the service, as mentioned in Document 4.

In addition, Document 5, ""datapower browser multiple wsdl web service proxy WS-Proxy TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)"", suggests that you can consider creating additional WS-Proxies to reduce the number of WSDLs per proxy to minimize the impact of the slowdown in browser performance when viewing a WS-Proxy configuration containing multiple WSDLs.
