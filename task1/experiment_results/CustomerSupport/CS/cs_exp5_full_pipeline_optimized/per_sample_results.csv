Document 4 also mentions that the problem will occur even if you have specified NAME-TRUNCATION=RIGHT in DFHWS2LS. So, it seems like the issue is on the generation side rather than the format of the copybooks.

Also, Document 1 mentions that the problem with level 88 fields with names longer than 30 characters in length is because 30 characters is the max length a cobol field can have.

However, Document 2 and Document 3 mention that the COBOL Copybook importer option may be missing after upgrading to WTX Design Studio 8.4.1.1 on the Windows platform over the top of an IBM WTX 8.4.1.0 installation. This issue is related to the installation process rather than the format of the cobol copybooks.

However, Document 4 provides a clue that if a gateway does not know how to route to the needed backend server IP address, it can cause unexpected connection failures. 

Considering the provided scenario in Document 5, where FSH_B is disabled, but traffic is still routed to MPGW_B after modifying its configuration, it is likely due to one of the following reasons:

1. The gateway (FSH_A or FSH_B) is not correctly routing traffic to MPGW_A, as stated in Document 4.
2. There is an issue with the routing configuration or the gateway's knowledge of how to route to the backend server.

A more detailed analysis of the configuration and the gateway's behavior would be necessary to determine the exact cause of the issue. However, the fact that the traffic is being routed to MPGW_B even though FSH_B is disabled suggests that the issue is related to the routing or gateway configuration rather than the MPGW configuration itself."

According to Document 1, the issue you are facing might be due to the fact that the server start-up is trying to use a port number that is within a conflict range with another installation. 

The resolution provided in Document 1 suggests that you should adjust the starting port numbers of each installation to be in a different range from the other installations. 

In your case, it seems that you are trying to start v9.0, which is using port 6002, and you have v8.4 installed on the same server, which might be using a different port number within the same range. 

To resolve this issue, you should follow the steps outlined in Document 1, specifically the ""Optional: Set port numbers in a different port range so that they cannot conflict"" section. 

This involves creating a deployment manager for the second installation (v9.0 in your case) by using the manageprofiles command, and then manually assigning a different port range for v9.0.

However, Document 2 (TECHNOTE) provides information about SSH connection failures after applying PTFs to 5733SC1 (OpenSSH), which might be related to the issue.

Document 2 (TECHNOTE) explains that applying PTFs R610, R710, and R720 to OpenSSH can cause SSH/SFTP/SCP connections to fail with error messages related to not matching ciphers, MAC algorithms, or kex algorithms. This issue occurs when the partner SSH server or client is running a very old version of the SSH/OpenSSH code.

Since you have mentioned v7.5.2, I will assume that the issue might be related to the change in the default set of ciphers, MACs, and kex algorithms in OpenSSH 6.7 and subsequent releases. 

However, the exact cause of the SSH connection failure after upgrading to v7.5.2 and above is not explicitly mentioned in any of the provided documents.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I would say that the context does not contain enough information to provide a specific answer to the question."

",0.4864864864864865,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Based on the provided context, the error ADMA8019E is related to the deployment target scope and the scope of the namespace bindings. 

The error message suggests that the resources assigned to the application are beyond the deployment target scope. However, it does not specify what the actual issue is or what the correct course of action should be.

Given that the namespace bindings are defined at the cell scope and the application is being deployed at the cluster scope, it is likely that the issue is due to the mismatch between the deployment target scope and the scope of the namespace bindings.

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that the namespace bindings are defined at the correct scope for the deployment target. In this case, since the application is being deployed at the cluster scope, the namespace bindings should be defined at the cell scope or the cluster scope.

You should not be concerned about this error if the JNDI lookup is occurring correctly after the application is deployed. However, you should investigate and resolve the issue to ensure that the application is deployed correctly and that the namespace bindings are defined at the correct scope.

When the MQ client connects to a queue manager that has the AMS component installed, it checks for the existence of an AMS policy on the queue. However, when the queue manager does not have the AMS component installed, the MQ client still attempts to check for the policy, resulting in the error AMQ9050.

This behavior has been observed with MQ v8 clients trying to connect to queue managers running MQ v7.0.1.x, as mentioned in the example provided.

To resolve this issue, you can either:

1. Upgrade the queue manager to a version that includes the AMS component, or
2. Disable the AMS function on the queue manager, as described in the LOCAL FIX section of Document 4.

Alternatively, you can use IBM MQ V8 classes for JMS/Java, as suggested in the LOCAL FIX section of Document 4, which should resolve the issue.

After I edited /config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/security.xml file, modified timeout setting to 2147483647, users are not able to login anymore.",0.7878787878787878,0.5151515151515151,0.6538461538461539,0.0,"You followed the Web GUI 8.1 reference guide to switch off the session timeout by modifying the timeout setting in the security.xml file to 2147483647. However, this is causing the issue.

According to the provided context documents (Document 1 and Document 2), using a big value (2147483647) for the session timeout setting in DASH is causing users to be locked out completely. This is because the timeout parameter used in the security.xml file is a WAS setting, but DASH is using a javascript call (settimeout), which causes a condition that prevents a login, if the timeout value is really big.

The solution to this problem is to set the custom property LTPAFIX in the consoleProperties.xml to ""false"" (Document 2).

However, I did not find any direct information in the provided context documents about modifying the timeout setting in the security.xml file for Web GUI 8.1. But the solution to the similar problem in Document 2 should be applied here as well. 

Therefore, the answer is: You should set the custom property LTPAFIX in the consoleProperties.xml to ""false"" to resolve the login issue."

techqa_DEV_Q154,"Why are some Datatypes corrupt after Impact cluster failover/failback ? 

Running Impact 7.1.0.11. The symptom is whenever Impact does a failover, a couple DataTypes
turn out empty.

I've checked the type files before and after Impact failover and the difference happens in the property

*.SQL.USERPARAMETERS

This property no longer exists for the corrupted datatypes"".
",0.4375,0.125,0.2857142857142857,0.0,"Based on the context documents, the issue of corrupt DataTypes after Impact cluster failover/failback seems to be related to the replication of large character lengths for the USERPARAMETERS parameter in the .type file. 

Document 2 mentions an APAR ""IZ81446"" which explains the issue of DataType not being correctly replicated across the ImpactServer Cluster due to the file size limit. Although the APAR is not an issue in Impact 6 and 7, it is recommended to include a property to increase the file size limit to handle large character lengths.

It is likely that a similar issue exists in Impact 7.1.0.11, leading to corrupt DataTypes after failover/failback. The missing property *.SQL.USERPARAMETERS in the corrupted DataTypes suggests that the issue is related to the replication of large character lengths.

To resolve this issue, you can try adding the property to increase the file size limit to the $NCHOME/impact/etc/<SERVERNAME>_server.props file, as mentioned in Document 2. This should help to prevent the corruption of DataTypes after failover/failback."

2. Then relaunch the RFT package.

Since the DataPower Gateway 7.1.0 WebService Proxy WebGUI no longer offers a ""Refresh"" button, you can use the following methods:

1. Restart the WebService Proxy: You can restart the WSP by stopping and then starting it again. This will force the WSP to re-read the WSDL file from the local filesystem.

2. Use the ""wsdl refresh"" command: You can use the ""wsdl refresh"" command in the DataPower CLI to refresh the WSDL. The command is as follows:
   wsdl refresh <wsdl-name>

   Replace <wsdl-name> with the name of your WSDL file.

3. Modify the URL Match expression in the WSDL Cache Policy: If you have a WSDL Cache Policy configured, you can modify the URL Match expression to include the latest WSDL file. This will cause the WSP to re-read the WSDL file from the local filesystem.

4. Use the ""refresh"" option in the WebService Proxy Policy: You can add a ""refresh"" option to the Web"
