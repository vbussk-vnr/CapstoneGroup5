You should use conversation sharing in DataPower MQ queue managers in the following situations:

* When mixed message sizes are used by the same mq-qm object, using case #2 will benefit the mq-qm object as it will use the new buffer management feature of IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 when making MQGET API calls.
* When using IBM WebSphere MQ V8 release, case #2 with a negotiated sharing conversations value of 1 will provide enhanced performance.
* When the firmware version of DataPower is 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x or later.

Additionally, it is recommended to use a value of 10 or less in the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object and verify the configuration empirically to make sure that the IBM WebSphere MQ server can sustain the load from DataPower with the negotiated Sharing Conversations of 10.

Note that in DataPower firmware releases 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier, you should follow case #1 and use a negotiated sharing conversations value of 0, as configuring these firmware versions with case #2 or case #3"

**Configuring the Machines for HTTPS:**

To configure the machines hosting the WebSphere Operational Decision Management modules for HTTPS, you should make sure that:

1. The WebSphere Application Server is properly configured for HTTPS. This includes setting up the SSL certificates and configuring the server to use these certificates for SSL connections.
2. The Scenario Service Provider (SSP) is configured to use the HTTPS protocol when communicating with Decision Center.

**Avoiding the SSLHandshakeException:**

The javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException is likely caused by a certificate trust issue. To avoid this exception, you can try the following:

1. Make sure that the SSL certificate used by the SSP is properly signed and trusted by the Decision Center server. This may involve installing the SSP's certificate in the Decision Center server's trust store.
2. Check the Java security settings on the Decision Center server to ensure that it is set to trust the SSP's certificate.

This problem is due to WebSphere MQ not checking the path containing the new hostname directory or attempting to create it after a hostname change.

To resolve this issue, you need to look at the following:

1. Check if the hostname has been changed since installing WebSphere MQ.
2. Check the path /var/mqm/sockets/@SYSTEM/qmgrlocl and ensure it contains a directory named after the new hostname.
3. Verify that the WebSphere MQ code has been updated to check for the existence of the directory named above and attempt to create it.
4. Consider applying the fix targeted for delivery in the following PTFs, as mentioned in Document 1 and Document 3.

If you have already tried the steps mentioned in the APAR information and the problem persists, you may need to look further into the issue by checking the MQ logs, configuration files, and system files for any errors or inconsistencies."

How can I workaround it. ,0.5698924731182796,0.22580645161290322,0.39622641509433965,0.0,"Unfortunately, the context documents do not contain specific information about the limitations of syslog-TCP log target using DataPower Gateways. However, based on the context of syslog protocol operating over UDP which has no guarantee on packet delivery, it can be inferred that the syslog-TCP protocol might also have limitations.

Given the information in Document 4 about Log Target, it is mentioned that ""Log target connections have no timeout options for the TCP-based methods such as SOAP and Syslog-ng."" This might be related to the issue you are experiencing.

However, there is no direct information about payload truncation when using syslog-TCP log target.

A possible workaround could be to use a different log target method, such as File type or HTTP service, as described in the context documents (Document 1, 2, 3).

It is recommended to contact IBM support for further assistance and to obtain the latest information about DataPower Gateways and its logging capabilities."

According to Document 1, you can use the DeleteChildType action from the Validations library to delete a document hierarchy node, such as a blank page. However, this action requires creating a special page type and attaching a rule to remove all pages with that type.

Although the exact action mentioned in Document 1 is for deleting blank pages, you should be able to adapt this method to delete pages based on their status.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Create a special page type attached at the batch level, similar to ""DeleteMe"".
2. Use an action to identify the pages with status 20 (e.g., you can create a custom action using a script to filter pages based on their status).
3. Attach a rule with the action DeleteChildType(DeleteMe) at the batch level to remove all pages with the special page type.

To address the ""Too many open files"" messages in the DASH systemOut log on an AIX box, you can try the following:

1. **Check the current limits**: Use the `ulimit -a` command to print the list of current limitations for the current session. Check the 'nofile(s)' limit, which represents the maximum number of open files allowed for a process.
2. **Increase the ulimit**: If the 'nofile(s)' limit is too small, increase it using the `ulimit -n` command. For example, to set the limit to 8192, use `ulimit -n 8192`.
3. **Check the limits of a running process**: Use the `procfiles` command to check the current settings for a running process. This will show the limit of file descriptors, which may be different from the default inherited from the shell.

Document 1 and Document 2 mention that using a big value (2147483647) for the session timeout setting in DASH is causing users to be locked out completely. The cause is that this timeout parameter used in the security.xml file is a WAS setting, but DASH is using a javascript call (settimeout), which causes a condition that prevents a login, if the timeout value is really big.

Since the Document 1 and Document 2 mention the same problem, the answer for the question is based on those two documents. 

The users are unable to login to Web GUI 8.1 after modifying the timeout to 2147483647 in security.xml file, because this causes a condition that prevents a login, similar to the issue described in Documents 1 and 2 for DASH. 

To resolve this issue, you should set the custom property LTPAFIX in the consoleProperties.xml to ""false"" as described in Documents 1 and 2."

Running Impact 7.1.0.11. The symptom is whenever Impact does a failover, a couple DataTypes

I've checked the type files before and after Impact failover and the difference happens in the property

This property no longer exists for the corrupted datatypes"".

However, Document 3 and Document 4 both describe similar issues with failover and clustering in Impact 5.1, but they do not address the specific issue of corrupt DataTypes. Document 1 describes a problem with the PolicyList file, but it does not mention DataTypes at all.

To answer the question, you may need to search for additional documentation or support resources that are specific to Impact 7.1.0.11 and the issue of corrupt DataTypes after failover/failback."

The error message in the log file indicates a `ClassNotFoundException` for `org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter`. This class is part of the Eclipse platform, and it's used by the RFT launcher to start the Eclipse instance.

The problem might be related to the RFT installation or the environment settings. Here are a few possible causes:

1. Corrupted RFT installation: The installation might be corrupted, which could cause the `ClassNotFoundException`.
2. Missing dependencies: The RFT launcher might be missing some dependencies, which could cause the `ClassNotFoundException`.
3. Environment settings: The environment settings, such as the classpath or the Java version, might be causing the issue.

To troubleshoot the issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the RFT installation: Make sure that the RFT installation is complete and not corrupted.
2. Verify the classpath: Check the classpath settings to ensure that the required classes are included.
3. Check the Java version: Ensure that the Java version is compatible with RFT.
4. Try launching RFT with the -clean option: This"
techqa_DEV_Q021,"How to refresh a DataPower WebService Proxy which WSDL got changed? I have made changes to a WSDL stored in DP local filesystem.

How can I make the WSP reflect this change since DataPower Gateway 7.1.0 WebService Proxy WebGUI doesn't offer the ""Refresh"" button anymore?

Is there a best practice to refresh the WSP if I modified my WSDL?",0.925,0.05,0.05405405405405406,1.0,"Based on the provided context documents, to refresh a DataPower WebService Proxy which WSDL got changed, you have two options:

1. Disable and re-enable the service, as mentioned in Document 3: The device will not poll WSDL files on the local store. The WSDL Cache policy works with WSDL files hosted on an external URL. To refresh a WSDL in the local:/// directory, disable and re-enable the service.

2. However, since DataPower Gateway 7.1.0 WebService Proxy WebGUI doesn't offer the ""Refresh"" button anymore, a better approach would be to use the WSDL Cache policy from an external URL and then change the URL to point to the local filesystem WSDL. Unfortunately, there's no clear mention of a ""best practice"" in the provided context documents.

It's worth noting that Document 3 explicitly states that there's an open issue with refreshing WSDL from a local:/// directory, and that the device is working as designed not to poll WSDL files on the local store."
