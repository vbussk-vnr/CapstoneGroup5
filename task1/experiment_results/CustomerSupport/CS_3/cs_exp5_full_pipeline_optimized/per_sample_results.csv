techqa_DEV_Q243,"Using cobol copybooks Sometimes, there will be errors/fields missing in typetree, while importing cobol copybooks. Is there any format for copybooks(specifically to be used in wtx), that we need to follow? ",0.3055555555555556,0.3055555555555556,1.0,0.0,"Based on the provided context, there is no specific format mentioned for cobol copybooks to follow when using them in WTX Design Studio. However, Document 1 mentions an error where the resulting cobol copybooks contain level 88 fields with names that are longer than 30 characters, resulting in errors at compile time. It is recommended to ensure that field names are 30 characters or less.

Additionally, Document 4 mentions that DFHWS2LS has been changed to generate valid COBOL level 88 field names. However, there is no mention of any specific format that should be followed for cobol copybooks.

It's worth noting that Document 2 and Document 3 mention a problem with the COBOL Copybook importer missing after an upgrade, but this is not related to the format of the cobol copybooks themselves.

Therefore, the answer is that there is no specific format mentioned for cobol copybooks to follow when using them in WTX Design Studio, but it is recommended to ensure that field names are 30 characters or less."

techqa_DEV_Q253,Want to find out if Microsoft Edge is supported with ICC? Want to find out Microsoft Edge is supported with ICC? ,0.07692307692307693,0.07692307692307693,1.0,1.0,"Based on the provided context documents, I found information related to Microsoft Edge in Document 1 and Document 4.

Document 1 states:

* Supported browsers 
  * Microsoft Edge on Windows 

This suggests that Microsoft Edge is supported on Windows platforms.

Document 4 states:

Document 4:
You only need to apply this if you use the Edge Caching Proxy.

This statement suggests that the document relates to Edge Caching Proxy, but does not provide information about the general support of Microsoft Edge.

However, since Document 1 provides information about Microsoft Edge being supported, we can conclude that Microsoft Edge is supported with ICC, specifically on Windows platforms."
