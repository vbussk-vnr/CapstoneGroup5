techqa_DEV_Q243,"Using cobol copybooks Sometimes, there will be errors/fields missing in typetree, while importing cobol copybooks. Is there any format for copybooks(specifically to be used in wtx), that we need to follow? ",0.2727272727272727,0.06818181818181818,0.25,0.0,"Based on the provided context documents, I couldn't find any specific information about a required format for COBOL copybooks to be used in IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) Design Studio. However, Document 2 mentions a problem with long field names in level 88 fields generated by DFHWS2LS.

In the problem description, it is mentioned that ""These names are used in Level88 fields in the language structure and are not truncated. It results in errors at compile time as COBOL cannot handle names that are longer than 30 characters.""

This suggests that the issue is related to the length of the field names, specifically that they should not exceed 30 characters."
