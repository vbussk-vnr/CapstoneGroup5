techqa_DEV_Q243,"Using cobol copybooks Sometimes, there will be errors/fields missing in typetree, while importing cobol copybooks. Is there any format for copybooks(specifically to be used in wtx), that we need to follow? ",0.2631578947368421,0.15789473684210525,0.6,0.0,"Based on the provided context documents, there is no specific mention of a required format for COBOL copybooks to be used in WTX. However, Document 1 mentions that the COBOL versions of copybooks DFHTCTTE and DFHJCADS were changed to use COBOL-style comments instead of PL/1 style comments, which was the cause of a compiler error.

Document 2 mentions that the problem was caused by level 88 fields with names longer than 30 characters in the cobol copybooks generated by DFHWS2LS. The problem was resolved by changing the code to generate valid COBOL level 88 field names.

Document 4 mentions that COBOL copybooks fail to download when BIDI options are enabled and the Property Group contains a COBOL SYSLIB with two or more PDSEs. However, this is a problem with the download process, not the format of the copybooks.

Document 5 is related to a problem with the Assembly Relation Position Matrix in ENOVIA V5 VPM, which does not seem to be related to the import of COBOL copybooks.

Document 3 mentions that the problem was caused by a deadlock that occurs when Software Analyzer is running while the copybooks"
techqa_DEV_Q280,Is WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) supported for IBM Integration Bus V10? When will WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) be supported for IBM Integration Bus V10?,0.12307692307692308,0.06153846153846154,0.5,1.0,"Based on the provided context documents, the information about WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) support for IBM Integration Bus V10 is not directly mentioned. However, Document 3 mentions the issue of ""DTXPlugin cannot be located"" when using ITX with IIB10.0.0.x, suggesting that WTX might be supported for IIB10, but the exact version of WTX and the support level are not specified.

To determine if WTX is supported for IIB V10 and when it will be supported, it is recommended to check official IBM documentation or support channels."
techqa_DEV_Q253,Want to find out if Microsoft Edge is supported with ICC? Want to find out Microsoft Edge is supported with ICC? ,0.4602076124567474,0.020761245674740483,0.045112781954887216,0.0,"Based on the provided context documents, I can answer your question.

The context documents do not explicitly mention Microsoft Edge in relation to IBM Content Collector (ICC). However, I can find information about Microsoft Edge in Document 1, which mentions that Microsoft Edge is a supported browser for IBM Watson Explorer Community Edition.

In Document 2, which discusses IBM Content Collector, there is a mention of Microsoft Edge, but it is in the context of IBM Content Collector 4.0.1 Fix Pack 2, where it is stated that Microsoft Edge is supported starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.1 Fix Pack 2.

Given this information, it appears that Microsoft Edge is supported with IBM Content Collector, specifically starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.1 Fix Pack 2. However, without more specific information about the version of ICC being used, I cannot confirm support for Microsoft Edge with earlier versions of ICC."
