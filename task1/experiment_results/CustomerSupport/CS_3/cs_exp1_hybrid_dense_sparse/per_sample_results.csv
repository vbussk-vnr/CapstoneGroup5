techqa_DEV_Q243,"Using cobol copybooks Sometimes, there will be errors/fields missing in typetree, while importing cobol copybooks. Is there any format for copybooks(specifically to be used in wtx), that we need to follow? ",0.1111111111111111,0.1111111111111111,1.0,0.0,"Based on the provided context, there is no direct information that addresses the specific question about the format for copybooks to be used in WTX. 

However, Document 5 provides some related information. It mentions that, when installing WTX Design Studio 8.4.1.1 on the Windows platform, the COBOL Copybook importer may be missing after the upgrade. It suggests that this issue can be resolved by installing WTX Design Studio 8.4.1.1 in an empty directory and then performing any installation customization.

It also mentions that some files are not correctly overwritten/modified during the upgrade. This implies that there may be specific requirements or formats for copybooks, but it does not explicitly state what those requirements are.

Therefore, I would recommend consulting the official documentation or contacting IBM support for more information on the specific requirements for copybooks in WTX."
