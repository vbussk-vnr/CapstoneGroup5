However, Document 1 does mention that if a party exceeds its respective ""Overhead MIPS"" for a year and the CPU-Based Software is required to be upgraded, the party first exceeding its Overhead MIPS (""CPU Triggering Party"") shall bear the full cost and expense of upgrading the CPU-Based Software licenses. If the other party (""non-CPU Triggering Party"") exceeds its Overhead MIPS during a respective year after an upgrade to a CPU-Based Software license is purchased, the non-CPU Triggering Party shall pay the CPU Triggering Party an amount equal to the total cost to the CPU Triggering Party of purchasing the upgrade multiplied by a fraction.

Document 4 allows each party to assign its rights, obligations, and privileges in connection with any merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of the business, but this is not a specific right of first refusal.

Document 5 does not grant a right of first refusal or first offer, but rather allows parties to develop and market competitive products and services without restrictions.

Document 2 reserves the rights to intellectual property, which does not specifically grant a right of first refusal or first offer.

Therefore, the clauses in Document 1 and Document 3 grant a right of first refusal to Network 1 and Pretzel Time, respectively."

However, Document 2, Clause 10.2 mentions a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license granted to each party to use the other party's intellectual property rights for the purpose of complying with their marketing and promotional obligations. This suggests that the parties have a limited right to use each other's intellectual property, but it does not imply joint or shared ownership.

Document 3, Section 2.4 (Ownership) and Section 2.5 (Rights Arising in the Future) specifically allocate ownership of intellectual property between RemainCo and SpinCo, with RemainCo retaining ownership of certain intellectual property and SpinCo retaining ownership of other intellectual property. This suggests that the parties intend to maintain separate ownership of their respective intellectual property.

Document 1 mentions that all rights not specifically granted in the contract are reserved to the applicable party, which may exercise the same rights except as otherwise restricted. This reinforces the idea that the parties intend to maintain separate ownership of their intellectual property.

In summary, while the parties have a limited right to use each other's intellectual property, there is no clause that explicitly provides for joint"

From Document 1, it is mentioned that each party acknowledges that the other party's Group may market or have under development products that are competitive with theirs, but this does not restrict their ability to compete. However, this does not provide a clear restriction on competition.

From Document 2, Section 11.3, it can be seen that Network Affiliate and its affiliates agree not to engage or participate in any business that competes with any business that NCM is authorized to conduct in the Territory. However, there are some exceptions to this restriction, such as if Network Affiliate acquires a competing business as an incidental part of an acquisition of another business, or if Network Affiliate has a direct or indirect ownership or other equity investments in a competing business that represents less than 10% of the voting power of all outstanding equity.

1. **Document 1:** Clause 10.1 states that any improvements, enhancements, modifications, or developments to a Party's intellectual property automatically vest in that Party, regardless of who generates the relevant improvement.

While there are some exceptions in certain documents, the typical limitation of liability language in these documents restricts the liability of the parties to specific amounts or types of damages.

For example, in Document 3, D2's liability is capped at the total amount paid or owed by the Licensee to D2 under the agreement. This suggests that the parties have intentionally limited their liability to a specific amount.

Additionally, in Document 1, the parties specifically disclaim any representations or warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. This language suggests that the parties have intentionally limited their liability for any damages arising from a breach of these implied warranties.

However, there are some exceptions in the documents that may allow for uncapped liability in certain circumstances. For example, in Document 2, the parties' liability for breaches of Section 3.1 (Grant of Rights), Section 5 (Confidentiality Provisions), or Sections 8.1 and 8.2 (Ownership and License) is not limited by the standard limitation of liability language.

However, the information does suggest that payments are due upon termination or expiration of the contract (Section 5(b) - (d) of Document 1, Document 3, and Document 4).

For example, Document 1 states that ""All payments that would be due pursuant to Sections 5(b) - (d) up to the date of any termination or expiration of this Agreement will be payable in full within thirty (30) days following such termination or expiration."" This implies that payments may be due upon termination or expiration of the contract, but it does not explicitly mention ""liquidated damages"" or ""termination fee"".

Document 2 describes a specific revenue sharing arrangement for advertising inventory exhibited in theaters, where each party receives 50% of the net revenue. However, this arrangement does not apply to other technologies, goods, or services.

Document 5 states that Bank of America retains the right to utilize other vendors in the provision of services and products, which implies that Bank of America does not have to share revenue or profit with the supplier for any technology, goods, or services provided under the agreement.

Therefore, the answer to the question is no, one party is not required to share revenue or profit with the counterparty for any technology, goods, or services, outside of the specific revenue sharing arrangement described in Document 2."

But, there is no specific restriction in the documents that would prevent a party from contesting the validity of the counterparty's ownership of intellectual property or bringing a claim against the counterparty for matters unrelated to the contract.

Document 5, though, does mention Third-Party Infringement (Section 8), but this mainly refers to obligations between parties for actions against third-party infringement, and does not explicitly restrict the parties from contesting each other's ownership claims.

If a party undergoes a change of control, such as a merger, stock sale, or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or business, it may assign the Agreement to a Third Party (Document 3, Section 10.2(b)), but the assignment is void and has no effect unless the assignee assumes the obligations of the assigning party in a written instrument, and other conditions are met.

However, it's worth noting that Document 4(c) mentions immediate termination if a petition in bankruptcy has been filed by or against the other party, but this applies to a more specific scenario and doesn't directly address a change of control.

In summary, upon a change of control, such as a merger, stock sale, or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or business, one party may assign the Agreement to a Third Party, but the assignment requires specific conditions to be met, and the counterparty does not have the right to terminate the Agreement solely based on the change of control."

There is a mention of customers being granted a sublicense (Document 1), but this does not necessarily imply that the affiliates of the Licensee/Sublicensor are included in the definition of ""Customers"" or have the right to sublicense.

Document 2, Section (e) states that Certegy grants Equifax a ""fully paid, non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, transferable license"" to use the Utility Software Programs. This indicates that the license granted is perpetual.

Document 5 also mentions a ""perpetual"" license grant, albeit with certain restrictions, in Section 4.4(a).

It's worth noting that Document 1 contains a warning that the license grants are provided ""AS-IS"" with no warranties, and the parties exclude and disclaim any warranties, but this does not affect the perpetual nature of the license grants."

Document 3 defines ""Minimum Order Quantity"" but doesn't provide its meaning without reference to the Facility Addendum.

Document 4 mentions that products must be ordered in the minimum and/or standard lot size quantities specified in the Price Schedule, but it's not clear if this is a purchase obligation on both parties.

Document 5 provides more specific information on the minimum order quantity: for Finished Product, each purchase order must be equal to or greater than the minimum order quantity, and for excess quantities, the customer must place purchase orders in increments above the minimum order quantity as specified in the Facility Addendum. 

Therefore, while there are conditions where a minimum order size or quantity may be required, it's not a straightforward answer. The minimum order quantity can vary depending on the specific product and the Facility Addendum."

Documents 2 and 5 explicitly state that the Parties are independent contractors, and neither Party shall be bound by or liable to any third persons for acts or obligations or debts incurred by the other toward such third party, except to the extent specifically agreed to in writing by the Party to be so bound. This suggests that certain Affiliates of the Parties (document 1, section 10.3) may be entitled to certain rights and benefits as third-party beneficiaries.

However, documents 3, 4, and 1 (sections 10.2, 10.3, and 5.10) also indicate that the contract does not intend to confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties themselves. Therefore, it is unclear whether these Affiliates or any other third parties have specific entitlements to enforce their rights against the contracting parties.

In summary, there appears to be some ambiguity regarding the extent to which non-contracting parties may be beneficiaries of the contract, but it seems likely that certain Affiliates or third parties may have some entitlements under specific circumstances."

Since the United States of America is a federal country, it's unlikely that the law of the USA would govern the interpretation of a contract in the context of these documents, which appear to be state-specific agreements.

Assuming that the documents are intended to be mutually exclusive, we can conclude that the states' laws mentioned would govern the interpretation of the contracts.

However, if we're looking for a single answer that applies to all contracts, we can consider the following:

- Documents 1 and 3 both state that California law governs the contract.
- Document 2 states that New York law governs the contract.
- Documents 4 and 5 both state that Nevada law governs the contract.

Since there is a tie between California and Nevada for the most documents (2), we can consider these two states as the most likely governing laws. However, without further context, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer.

In a real-world scenario, the governing law would depend on the context, jurisdiction, and other factors"

But this license is limited to the specific purpose of complying with marketing and promotional obligations and does not extend to any other commercial purpose.

Additionally, Document 2 states that the license grants are provided ""as-is"" with no warranties, which suggests that any license granted is limited in scope and does not imply any unlimited or unrestricted usage.

Document 3 states that nothing in the Agreement limits or restricts the Licensee from entering into any similar agreements with any third party, but this does not imply an unlimited or unrestricted license under the current Agreement.

Therefore, there is no explicit clause granting an ""enterprise,"" ""all you can eat,"" or unlimited usage license."
