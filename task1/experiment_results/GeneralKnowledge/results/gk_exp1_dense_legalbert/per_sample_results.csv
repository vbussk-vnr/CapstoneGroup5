Document 1 does not provide the renewal term duration after the initial term expires.

Document 2 does provide information about the renewal term. It has an Initial Term of 5 years and an Extended Term of 3 years. This means that after the Initial Term expires, the term will automatically be extended for an additional 3 years.

Document 3 does not provide information about the renewal term, but it does provide information about the option to elect to extend the term for additional 2-year periods.

Document 4 provides information about the renewal term. It has an Initial Term of **** years (the exact duration is not provided in the context), and any subsequent Renewal Term is also **** years in duration (the exact duration is not provided in the context).

Document 5 does not provide information about the renewal term.

Since Documents 1, 3, 4, and 5 do not provide sufficient information about the specific renewal term duration, the most comprehensive answer based on the available data is from Document 2, which states that after the Initial Term, the term will automatically be extended for an additional 3 years.

Document 4 mentions a ""Non-solicitation of Clients"" clause, which states that Marketing Affiliate shall not directly or indirectly solicit an existing business customer of Equidata during the term and condition of this Agreement, except for joint marketing purposes.

However, this restriction appears to be limited to the duration of the Agreement, as it explicitly mentions ""during the term and condition of this Agreement.""

Document 2, Section 7.3, contains a ""Noncompetition"" clause that restricts CONSULTANT from engaging in or performing services for any Competitor, which includes entities that advise or invest in flex/industrial, retail, multifamily, and limited service hotel real estate. This restriction is in place for a period of 12 months after the termination of CONSULTANT's consultancy with the Company.

Document 2 does not explicitly state that this restriction applies only to the duration of the consultancy, but it does mention a 12-month period after the termination of the consultancy. Therefore, it is likely that the restriction applies for a limited time period.

However, Section 14.3 of Document 3 provides that upon the termination or expiration of the term of this Agreement, the Licensee shall return or destroy all copies of the Licensed Products and any materials associated with the Licensed Products in Licensee's possession or control.

However, in Document 1, it is mentioned that both parties agree to indemnify each other from any damages arising out of any finding of fact which is inconsistent with Designer's (or Client's) representations and warranties. This implies that both parties are expected to behave in a manner that is consistent with their representations and warranties.

In the absence of an explicit non-disparagement clause, it can be inferred that any disparagement of the counterparty may be considered a breach of the representations and warranties made by the designer or client. However, this is not a direct requirement not to disparage the counterparty.

It's worth noting that Document 1 mentions that both parties agree to indemnify each other, which may provide some protection against damages arising from disparagement. However, without an explicit non-disparagement clause, it is not clear whether such a breach would be considered a material breach of the agreement that would allow the other party to terminate the agreement."

This indicates that the manufacturer is restricted from acquiring any rights or interests in the customer's property, which could imply a limitation on contesting the customer's ownership.

Similarly, Document 4 also states that ""Customer-Owned Improvements and Developments shall be the exclusive property of Customer, and Customer shall own all rights, title and interest in and to such Customer-Owned Improvements and Developments.""
