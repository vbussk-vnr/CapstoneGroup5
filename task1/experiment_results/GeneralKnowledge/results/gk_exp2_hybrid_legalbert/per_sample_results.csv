However, the specific question is about contesting the validity of the counterparty's ownership of intellectual property or bringing a claim against the counterparty for matters unrelated to the contract. This is not directly addressed in the provided context documents.

Document 2, Section 16, states that Garman ""shall maintain on each AS400 at an Authorized Location the most current version of"" the source code, program and user documentation, and other related materials.

The document states that the Licensor shall compile and provide the calculation of profit participation to the Licensee, but it doesn't specify the terms of the profit sharing.
* Document 3: It mentions royalties to be paid by Manufacturer to Subcontractor for each of Manufacturer's Product purchased under the Agreement. The royalty payments are calculated as a percentage of the Product Cost or a fixed amount per unit.
* Document 4: It doesn't mention revenue or profit sharing explicitly, but it discusses Tax matters and VAT (Value-Added Tax) reimbursement.

Based on these findings, it appears that in some agreements (e.g., Document 3), one party is required to share revenue or profit with the counterparty in the form of royalties.

This implies that if the Client makes negative comments about the work or the Developer, it could be considered a breach of the Agreement.

In Document 2, Section 17.2 Publicity, it states that neither party shall use the name, trade name, service marks, trademarks, trade dress, or logos of the other party in publicity releases, advertising, or any other publication without the prior written consent in each instance.

Document 2, Section 5.2 states:

""If LICENSOR is not the sole and exclusive owner of all of the foregoing intellectual property rights to the Content, LICENSOR has been granted by the owner or rightful sub-licensee of the intellectual property of the Content the right to grant the rights provided by LICENSOR to plan_b under this Agreement.""

This suggests that Licensor may not be the sole owner of all the intellectual property rights to the Content, and instead, has been granted the right to grant those rights by the owner or rightful sub-licensee, which could be an affiliate of Licensor.

However, it is not explicitly stated that the license grant includes intellectual property of affiliates of the licensor, but rather that Licensor has been granted the right to grant rights by the owner or rightful sub-licensee of the intellectual property."

However, Document 4 mentions a section where Licensor grants plan_b a license to produce, use, distribute, promote, and publicly display the Content in any possible way for distribution and marketing purposes (Section 5.3). Additionally, Licensor grants plan_b the right to use the trademarks, trade names, or logos relating to Content (the ""TRADEMARKS"").

Document 5 also mentions the Group shall use its reasonable endeavours to obtain from the applicable PRC regulatory authorities such licenses as are necessary for the operation of their respective businesses in the PRC (""Operating Licenses"") (Section 9.1).

However, neither of these documents explicitly mentions an ""enterprise"" or ""all you can eat"" license.

However, Document 5, which is from CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019, mentions Article VII, which is not provided in the document. But in Document 1, it is stated that the Client and the Designer both agree to indemnify, save and hold armless each other from any and all damages, liabilities, costs, losses or expenses arising out of any finding of fact which is inconsistent with Designer's representations and warranties made herein. This could imply that the parties are expected to maintain a positive relationship and not engage in any activity that would harm the other party's reputation.

However, there is a provision in Document 4, which is from BRAVATEK SOLUTIONS, INC., 8-K, 4/18/2017, that requires the parties to keep in trust and confidence all such Proprietary Information of the other party, and shall not use such Proprietary Information other than in the course of its duties as expressly provided in this Agreement.

Document 1 does not mention any restriction on contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty.

Document 2, Section Ten, does not explicitly restrict the Company from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the NFLA, but it does restrict the Company from using the NFLA's identification or name after the termination of the contract.

Document 4, NON-SOLICITATION, restricts each Party from soliciting, interfering with, or enticing away any employee or contractor of the other Party, both during the contract and for a period of six months thereafter.

Document 5 does not mention any restriction on contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty.

However, in cases where a joint marketing agreement is in place (as mentioned in Document 3), it's likely that the parties would agree to some level of non-solicitation or non-circumvention to protect their mutual interests.

* Document 3 (Section (h) Assignment): Neither party may assign its rights, duties, or obligations under this Agreement to any third party in whole or in part, without the other party's prior written consent. However, certain exceptions apply, such as assignment to affiliates or subsidiaries without consent.
* Document 4 (Section 15.6): Neither party may assign the Agreement without the written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except for assignment to an affiliate or successor by way of purchase, merger, consolidation, or similar transaction.

In general, it seems that consent or notice is typically required from the other party when assigning the contract to a third party, although there are some exceptions for assignments to affiliates or subsidiaries."

However, the context suggests that in some cases, consent or notice is required for termination, such as in Document 2 (clause 6.3) where a party can terminate upon 60 days' prior written notice if the other party materially defaults.

Document 4 (Section 8.2) mentions that a party may terminate this Agreement effective immediately upon delivery of a Termination Notice if the other Party is dissolved or is seeking to dissolve itself, or if the other Party becomes subject to an Insolvency Event. However, this does not explicitly mention a change of control.

Document 5 (Section 5) does not mention a change of control as a reason for termination.

However, Document 1 (Section 3) mentions a transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or business as a reason for termination (clause (iii)).

Therefore, the context suggests that while a change of control may be a reason for termination, it is not explicitly stated that consent or notice is required from the counterparty.

For Document 2, Section 26.2, it is stated that SEV may sub-contract the performance of its obligations under this Agreement with the consent of DCL. However, Section 26.3 states that SEV shall not engage agents or sub-contractors to provide the Maintenance Services without DCL's prior consent.

This implies that a party is not restricted from contesting the validity of the counterparty's ownership of intellectual property. However, according to the same section, a party also has no obligation to institute or defend an action or suit regarding such matters.

Regarding bringing a claim against the counterparty for matters unrelated to the contract, Document 1 does not explicitly state that a party is restricted from doing so. However, it does suggest that the agreement focuses on intellectual property-related matters, and a party's obligations and restrictions are primarily related to those issues.

This provision states that upon termination of the Agreement, the Developer will transfer all Works to the Client as of the date of termination.

While this provision does not explicitly mention ""disparagement,"" it suggests that the parties should maintain a level of cooperation and respect towards each other, even after the termination of the Agreement.

In Document 3 (Section 17.2), there is a provision that deals with publicity and advertising. It states that the parties shall not use each other's name, trade name, service marks, trademarks, trade dress, or logos in publicity releases, advertising, or any other publication without prior written consent. However, this provision is not directly related to disparagement.

In summary, while there is no explicit requirement on a party not to disparage the counterparty, the provisions mentioned above suggest that the parties should maintain a level of cooperation and respect towards each other, even after the termination of the Agreement."
