(ii) If either party, prior to or at the time of the complete separation of LPARs (described in subsection (i) above), exceeds its respective Projected MIPS for any year, and, thereafter, any of the MIPS-Based Software is required, under the terms of the respective software licenses, to be upgraded to allow usage of the additional MIPS, the party first exceeding its respective Projected MIPS (""Triggering Party"") shall bear the full cost and expense of upgrading the MIPS-Based Software licenses (whether or not such party ultimately caused the MIPS limitations to be exceeded).

This indicates that if one party's use of the product/services exceeds a certain threshold (in this case, their Projected MIPS), the party responsible for the excess usage (the ""Triggering Party"") will bear the cost and expense of upgrading the related software licenses. 

However, there is another section in Document 5 that further clarifies the situation:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after an upgrade to a MIPS-Based Software license is purchased, if the non-Triggering Party exceeds its Projected MIPS during a respective year, such non-Triggering Party shall pay the Triggering Party an amount"

Document 2 mentions a non-competition clause that restricts the Member from engaging in certain business activities within a 3-mile radius of the premises of their Franchised Business or any other Franchised Business operating under the System. This clause applies during the Post-Term Period, which is a continuous uninterrupted period of 2 years from the date of a transfer, expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement, termination of employment, or a final order of a court or arbitrator.

In Document 1, Clause 10.1 states that ""any improvements, enhancements, modifications or developments to a Party's intellectual property shall automatically vest in that Party irrespective of who generates the relevant improvement, enhancement, modification or development."" This means that intellectual property created by one party remains the property of that party, and does not automatically become the property of the counterparty.

In Document 2, Section (e) Employee and Consultant Obligations, it is stated that employees and consultants of a party are contractually obligated to assign to the party all intellectual property rights conceived, made, or discovered by them in connection with their work for the party. This suggests that intellectual property created by employees and consultants of one party does become the property of that party.

In Document 3, it is stated that ""Any modifications, enhancements or Derivative Works lawfully made by either party to any of the foregoing assets shall be owned by the entity that modified or enhanced such asset or created such Derivative Work from such asset."" This means that intellectual property created by one party as a modification, enhancement, or derivative work of an existing asset remains the property of that party.

This includes a commitment to procure all “requirements” from one party of certain technology, goods, or services or a prohibition on licensing or selling technology, goods or services to third parties, or a prohibition on  collaborating or working with other parties), whether during the contract or  after the contract ends (or both).",0.42857142857142855,0.04285714285714286,0.1,1.0,"Based on the provided context documents, there are some clauses that suggest exclusivity, but they are not all-encompassing. Here's a breakdown:

* Document 2 (Section 2.1(e)(i)) mentions exclusivity during the Exclusivity Period, where the Customer agrees to purchase at least the Exclusive Purchase Requirement of its requirements for a certain Product SKU in a specific country from the Manufacturer. However, this exclusivity only applies to the Exclusive Purchase Requirement and does not extend to other quantities.
* Document 2 also allows the Customer to manufacture or have Product manufactured by a Third Party during the Exclusivity Period, in amounts in addition to the Purchase Orders for Product issued to Manufacturer.
* Document 4 does not mention exclusivity, but it does require the Reseller to immediately discontinue any use of the Company's name, logotype, Marks, or slogans, and to cease promoting, soliciting orders for, or procuring orders for the Product upon termination or expiration of the Agreement.

In summary, there is an exclusive dealing commitment with the counterparty in Document 2, but it is limited to purchasing a certain minimum quantity of Product SKUs during the Exclusivity Period. However, the Customer is not prohibited from manufacturing or having Product manufactured by"

However, Document 3 contains a section on sublicensing, which mentions that the licenses granted in Article 5 can be assigned in whole or in part to Affiliates of the licensor (Section 5.6(a)(i)). This implies that the licensor's affiliates may have the right to sublicense the licensed intellectual property, but it does not explicitly mention a license grant by the affiliates themselves.

Additionally, Document 2 mentions that each party grants a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to the other party to use their intellectual property rights (Section 10.2). However, there is no mention of a license grant by affiliates of the licensor.

Therefore, I would answer that the contract does not explicitly contain a license grant by affiliates of the licensor or that includes intellectual property of affiliates of the licensor. However, it does mention the possibility of sublicensing by affiliates of the licensor."

This suggests that any disputes related to ownership or validity of Joint IP must be resolved through consultation and agreement between the parties.

Similarly, in Document 5, Section 2.4, it is stated that if a party has a good faith belief that there is an error in the allocation of ownership of any item of Intellectual Property, they must provide written notice to the other party and the parties must negotiate in good faith a mutually agreeable resolution.

Document 3 (Section 5.9) states that each party may enforce its own patents and other intellectual property rights, as well as defend against any assertions of invalidity, unenforceability, or ownership of such patents. This suggests that parties may contest the validity of their counterparty's ownership of intellectual property.

Document 5 (Section 2.4(a) and (b)) also implies that ownership of intellectual property is to be mutually agreed upon between parties, and in case of a discrepancy, parties are to negotiate a mutually agreeable resolution. This does not explicitly restrict parties from contesting the validity of their counterparty's ownership of intellectual property.

However, Document 5 (Section 2.4(c)) provides a provision for resolving errors or discrepancies regarding the allocation of ownership of intellectual property, which suggests that parties may work together to resolve such issues.
