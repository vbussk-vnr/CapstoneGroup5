In Document 1, Section (a) mentions that each Party agrees to assign an undivided one-half right, title, and interest in and to all Joint IP to the other Party. However, this is an assignment of ownership, not a joint or shared ownership arrangement.

Document 2, Section 2.4, mentions that RemainCo is the sole and exclusive owner of the Intellectual Property set forth on Schedule 2.4(a), and SpinCo is the sole and exclusive owner of the Intellectual Property set forth on Schedule 2.4(b). This suggests that each Party is the sole owner of their respective IP, rather than sharing ownership.

Document 5, Section 5.2, mentions a license to use intellectual property rights, but it does not suggest joint or shared ownership.

While these provisions do not explicitly prohibit the parties from collaborating or working with other parties, they do suggest a level of independence and non-liability for each other's actions.

However, there are some provisions that could be interpreted as restrictive of the parties' behavior, such as:

Document 1 describes the renewal term for the Agreement as follows:

Document 2 also describes the renewal term for the Agreement as follows:

- The Agreement shall automatically continue following the Initial Term, for an additional period of three (3) years (Extended Term).

Document 4 states that the Agreement shall automatically be renewed for additional periods of **** (Renewal Term) unless a Party provides written notification of non-renewal to the other Party at least **** of the Initial Term or a Renewal Term.

Document 3, 5, and 4 do not contain this specific information. However, since it's stated in Document 1 and 2 that the renewal term is three years, we can infer that the renewal term after the initial term expires is three years.

However, Document 1 and 2 does not contain the information about **** in Document 4 and it does not contain the information about the renewal periods in Document 3.

However, in Document 3, Section 5.9, it is mentioned that when it comes to disputes with Third Parties respecting the infringement, validity, enforceability, or ownership of any Joint IP, the Parties shall confer and consult with each other for the purpose of determining the best approach within such actions, and neither Party shall take any action to enforce or defend any Joint IP without the other Party's prior written consent. This suggests that in the context of Joint IP, the Parties have agreed to consult and coordinate their actions when disputing the validity or ownership of such IP.

It does not specify a minimum order quantity, but rather a minimum order size in terms of Batch Size.

Document 2 also states that for Finished Products, each Purchase Order must be equal to or greater than the Minimum Order Quantity for such applicable Product as set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum. Additionally, if the Customer places Purchase Orders that exceed the applicable Minimum Order Quantity, the Customer must place such Purchase Orders for such excess quantities in Increments above the Minimum Order Quantity as specified in the applicable Facility Addendum.

Additionally, in Document 2, Section 2.4(a) and (b) mention the allocation of ownership of Intellectual Property between the parties, but it does not explicitly state joint or shared ownership.

In Document 3, the Intellectual Property Agreement between The Babcock & Wilcox Company and Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. contains various sections that discuss ownership and allocation of intellectual property, including Section 2.4, which states that one party is the sole and exclusive owner of certain intellectual property, but it does not explicitly provide for joint or shared ownership.

Document 1 does not explicitly state that consent or notice is required for assigning a contract to a third party. However, Section 10.3 states that this Agreement does not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties, and only the Affiliates of the Parties are intended to be third-party beneficiaries.

In Document 1, Section 15.8 Amendment, it is stated that the Agreement may be amended only by written amendment duly signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. 

However, there is no specific provision in the documents that directly addresses termination due to a change of control. 

But, in Document 3, it is stated that a party may terminate the Agreement if the other party (the ""Defaulter"") undergoes certain events such as a change of control, including a merger, stock sale, transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or business, or assignment by operation of law. However, this document is not signed by all the parties mentioned in the context.

In Document 5, it is stated that this Agreement shall inure solely to the benefit of, and shall be binding upon, the Agent, the Company, the MHC, the Bank, and their respective successors and assigns, and no other person shall have or be construed to have any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of or by virtue of this Agreement or any provision herein contained."

From Document 1, Section 10.3, it states that ""Except as expressly set forth in Section 5.10 and except for the Affiliates of the Parties, which are intended to be third-party beneficiaries hereunder, this Agreement does not and is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties.""

However, Document 2, Section F, states that ""The benefits of the Agreement shall inure to the respective successors and assignees of the parties and assigns and representatives, and the obligations and liabilities assumed in this Agreement by the parties hereto shall be binding upon their respective successors and assigns; provided that the rights and obligations of UTK under this Agreement may not be assigned or delegated without the prior written consent of AVDU and any such purported assignment shall be null and void.""

It also states that such customers shall receive only a personal, non-transferable and non-exclusive right to use such copy of the Licensed Certegy Materials, which suggests that the sublicense is being granted to these customers.

Additionally, Document 5 mentions ""Redistributors and Customers"" in the context of making Sublicense Copies and copies of the Documentation, which suggests that these individuals or organizations are also beneficiaries of the license grant.

However, the extent of the license grant to affiliates of the licensee/sublicensor is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. It is only mentioned in Document 4 that the sublicense by Equifax and other members of the Equifax Group to their customers shall be pursuant to written agreements with such customers, which implies that the sublicense is being granted to these customers, but it does not explicitly mention the affiliates of the licensee/sublicensor."

Document 2, Section 2.9, states that ""No Party shall have any obligation to provide any inventor incentive compensation to an employee of the other Party except as required by law."" This suggests that a party may contest the validity of the counterparty's ownership of intellectual property if there is a dispute over inventor incentive compensation.

In Document 1, it mentions a ""marketing fee"" that may be a percentage of the margin received by the other Party, but this is in the context of a joint marketing agreement that is mutually agreed upon by the Parties in a separate document. There is no indication that this is a universal requirement for all agreements or transactions.

In Document 5, Article II, Section 2.4, it mentions the ownership of Intellectual Property, but there is no mention of revenue or profit sharing.

However, in Document 1, it mentions that the Parties will coordinate external communications, including joint press releases, regarding their collaboration, which could potentially imply some level of shared success or responsibility.

Document 2 Section 11 (iii) states that ""Contractor may not retain any copy of the Licensed Source Code... and, upon completion of the project for which Contractor was permitted access to the Licensed Source Code or termination of this Agreement, shall return or destroy..."" This suggests that the license grant is not irrevocable, as the contractor is required to return or destroy the licensed source code upon termination of the agreement.

Document 3 does not explicitly state that the license grant is irrevocable or perpetual. Section 14.3 (a) states that ""within five (5) days of written demand by Licensor to Licensee, Licensee shall return or destroy all copies of the Licensed Products and any materials associated with the Licensed Products in Licensee's possession or control,"" which implies that the license grant can be terminated.
