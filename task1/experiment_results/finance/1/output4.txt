rescue and presidential helicopter programs , offset by a decline in volume due to the wind-down or completion of certain programs . operating profit is expected to decline in the mid single digit percentage range from 2014 levels , driven by a reduction in expected risk retirements in 2015 . accordingly , operating profit margin is expected to slightly decline from 2014 levels . space systems

financial statements 2014 ( continued ) we determine the discount rate used in the measurement of our obligations based on a model that matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date . when that timing does not correspond to a published high-quality bond rate , our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate . the yields on the bonds are used to derive a discount rate for the liability . the term of our obligation , based on the expected retirement dates of our workforce , is approximately eight years . in developing our expected rate of return assumption , we have evaluated the actual historical performance and long-term return projections of the plan assets , which give consideration to the asset mix and the anticipated timing of the plan outflows . we employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for what we consider a prudent level of risk . the intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run . risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities , plan funded status and our financial condition . the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments . furthermore , equity investments are diversified across u.s . and non-u.s . stocks as well as growth , value , and small and large capitalizations . derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner ; however , derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying investments . investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements , periodic asset and liability studies , and quarterly investment portfolio reviews .

of diluted earnings per common share excluded 8.0 million , 13.4 million , and 14.7 million stock options for the years ended december 31 , 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive , primarily due to their exercise prices exceeding the average market price of our common stock during each respective reporting period . note 3 2013 information on business segments we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered . effective december 31 , 2012 , we operate in five business segments : aeronautics , information

electronic systems business segment into the new mfc and mst business segments in order to streamline our operations and enhance customer alignment . in connection with this reorganization , management layers at our former electronic systems business segment and our former global training and logistics ( gtl ) business were eliminated , and the former gtl business was split between the two new business segments . in addition , operating results for sandia corporation , which manages the sandia national laboratories for the u.s . department of energy , and our equity interest in the u.k . atomic weapons establishment joint venture were transferred from our former electronic systems business segment to our space systems business segment . the amounts , discussion , and

segments : 2030 aeronautics 2013 engaged in the research , design , development , manufacture , integration , sustainment , support , and upgrade of advanced military aircraft , including combat and air mobility aircraft , unmanned air vehicles , and related technologies . 2030 information systems & global solutions 2013 provides management services , integrated information technology solutions ,

new standard on december 30 , 2018 , the first day of fiscal 2019 , and used the effective date as the date of initial application . consequently , financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . cadence elected certain practical expedients permitted under the

✅ using groq response is Unfortunately, I don't have enough information to answer the question directly. However, I can suggest how to find the answer.

The ratio of total American personnel to US Airways personnel can be calculated by dividing the total number of American personnel by the number of US Airways personnel.

However, the provided documents do not contain the total number of American personnel, as well as the break down of personnel in other entities.

However, Document 2 provides information about the personnel count for various job categories for American Airlines, but it does not include the count of US Airways personnel.

Document 3 mentions that the airline competes with US Airways, but it does not provide any information about the personnel count.

Document 5 provides information about the fuel consumption of American Airlines, but it does not provide any information about the personnel count.

Document 9 provides information about the labor costs and expenses of American Airlines, but it does not provide any information about the personnel count for US Airways.

Document 10 is a company name, and it does not provide any information about the personnel count.

To answer the question, you would need to have additional information about the personnel count for US Airways.
