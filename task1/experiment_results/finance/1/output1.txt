portion of that charge beginning in october 2011 . see notes 3 and 8 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the settlement and benefit sharing . the purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to price increases for ongoing purchased power capacity and additional capacity purchases . the net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to lower margins on co-owner contracts and higher wholesale energy costs . the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 2061 gwh in weather-adjusted usage across all sectors . weather-adjusted residential retail sales growth reflected an increase in the number of customers . industrial sales growth has continued since the beginning of 2010 . entergy 2019s service territory has benefited from the national manufacturing economy and exports , as well as industrial facility expansions . increases have been offset to some extent by declines in the paper , wood products , and pipeline segments . the increase was also partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales . the ano decommissioning trust variance is primarily related to the deferral of investment gains from the ano 1 and 2 decommissioning trust in 2010 in accordance with regulatory treatment . the gains resulted in an increase in interest and investment income in 2010 and a corresponding increase in regulatory charges with no effect on net income . the retail electric price variance is primarily due to : rate actions at entergy texas , including a base rate increase effective august 2010 and an additional increase beginning may 2011 ; a formula rate plan increase at entergy louisiana effective may 2011 ; and a base rate increase at entergy arkansas effective july 2010 . these were partially

directly under the caa . in response to a 2012 ruling by the u.s . court of appeals district of columbia circuit requiring the epa to make a final determination on whether aircraft ghg emissions cause or contribute to air pollution , which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare , the epa announced in september 2014 that it is in the process of making a determination regarding aircraft ghg emissions and anticipates proposing an endangerment finding by may 2015 . if the epa makes a positive endangerment finding , the epa is obligated under the caa to set ghg emission standards for aircraft . several states are also considering or have adopted initiatives to regulate emissions of ghgs , primarily through the planned development of ghg emissions inventories and/or regional ghg cap and trade programs . these regulatory efforts , both internationally and in the u.s . at the federal and state levels , are still developing , and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be in the u.s. , the eu or in other areas in which we do business . depending on the scope of such regulation , certain of our facilities and

the number of tariff miles . gross and revenue-ton-miles decreased 17% ( 17 % ) and 15% ( 15 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 16% ( 16 % ) decrease in carloads . commodity mix changes ( notably

decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to lower outstanding balances on the company 2019s lines of credit associated with the financing of the company 2019s investment and operating activities . the company has maintained a significantly lower balance on its lines of credit throughout 2001 compared to 2000 , as a result of its property dispositions proceeds used to fund future development , combined with a lower development level as a result of the slower economy . additionally , the company paid off $ 128.5 million of secured mortgage loans throughout 2001 , as well as an $ 85 million unsecured term loan . these decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense on unsecured debt as a result of the company issuing $ 175.0 million of debt in february 2001 , as well as a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized in 2001 versus 2000 , because of the decrease in development activity by the company . as a result of the above-mentioned items ,

service operations revenues decreased from $ 82.8 million for the year ended december 31 , 2000 , to $ 80.5 million for the year ended december 31 , 2001 . the company experienced a decrease of $ 4.3 million in net general contractor revenues from third party jobs because of a decrease in the volume of construction in 2001 , compared to 2000 , as well as slightly lower profit margins . this decrease is the effect of businesses delaying or terminating plans to expand in the wake of the slowed economy . property management , maintenance and leasing fee revenues decreased approximately $ 2.7 million mainly because of a decrease in landscaping maintenance revenue associated with the sale of the landscape business in the third quarter of 2001 ( see discussion below ) . construction management and development activity income represents construction and development fees earned on projects where the company acts as the construction manager along with profits from the company 2019s held for sale program whereby the company develops a property for sale upon completion . the increase in revenues of $ 2.2 million in 2001 is primarily because of an increase in profits on the sale of properties from the held for sale program . other income increased approximately $ 2.4 million in 2001 over 2000 ; due to a $ 1.8 million gain the company recognized on the sale of its landscape business in the third quarter of 2001 . the sale of the landscape business resulted in a total net profit of over $ 9 million after deducting all related expenses . this gain will be recognized in varying amounts over the next seven years because the company has an on-going contract to purchase future services from the buyer . service operations expenses decreased by $ 4.7 million for the year ended december 31 , 2001 , compared to the same period in 2000 , as the company reduced total overhead costs throughout 2001 in an effort to minimize the effects of decreased construction and development activity . the primary savings were experienced in employee salary and related costs through personnel reductions and reduced overhead costs from the sale of the landscaping business . as a result , earnings from service operations increased from $ 32.8 million for the year ended december 31 , 2000 , to $ 35.1 million for the year ended december 31 , 2001 . general and administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased from $ 21.1 million in 2000 to $ 15.6 million for the year ended december 31 , 2001 , through overhead cost reduction efforts . in late 2000 and continuing throughout 2001 , the company introduced several cost cutting measures to reduce the amount of overhead , including personnel reductions , centralization of responsibilities and reduction of employee costs such as travel and entertainment . other income and expenses gain on sale of land and depreciable property dispositions , net of impairment adjustment , was comprised of the following amounts in 2001 and 2000 : gain on sales of depreciable properties represent sales of previously held for investment rental properties . beginning in 2000 and continuing into 2001 , the company pursued favorable opportunities to dispose of real estate assets that no longer meet long-term investment objectives . gain on land sales represents sales of undeveloped land owned by the company . the company pursues opportunities to dispose of land in markets with a high concentration of undeveloped land and those markets where the land no longer meets strategic development plans of the company . the company recorded a $ 4.8 million asset impairment adjustment in 2001 on a single property that was sold in 2002 . other expense for the year ended december 31 , 2001 , includes a $ 1.4 million expense related to an interest rate swap that does not qualify for hedge accounting . net income available for common shares net income available for common shares for the year ended december 31 , 2001 was $ 230.0 million compared to $ 213.0 million for the year ended december 31 , 2000 . this increase results primarily from the operating result fluctuations in rental and service

the minimum tier 1 leverage ratio applicable to us from 3% ( 3 % ) to 4% ( 4 % ) effective january 1 , 2014 . in addition , the revised capital framework will introduce a new tier 1 supplementary leverage ratio ( supplementary leverage ratio ) for advanced approach banking organizations . the supplementary leverage ratio compares tier 1 capital ( as defined under the revised capital framework ) to a measure of leverage exposure , defined as the sum of the firm 2019s assets less certain cet1 deductions plus certain off-balance-sheet exposures , including a measure of derivatives exposures and commitments . the revised capital framework requires a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3% ( 3 % ) , effective january 1 , 2018 , but with disclosure required beginning in the first quarter of 2015 . in addition , subsequent to the approval of the revised capital framework , the agencies issued a proposal to increase the minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement for the largest u.s . banks ( those deemed to be global systemically important banking institutions ( g-sibs ) under the basel g-sib framework ) . these proposals would require the firm and other g-sibs to meet a 5% ( 5 % ) supplementary leverage ratio ( comprised of the minimum requirement of 3% ( 3 % ) plus a 2% ( 2 % ) buffer ) . as of december 2013 , our estimated supplementary leverage ratio based on the revised capital framework approximates this proposed minimum . in addition , the basel committee recently finalized revisions that would increase the size of the leverage exposure for purposes of the supplementary leverage ratio , but would retain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 3% ( 3 % ) . it is not known with certainty at this point whether the u.s . regulators will adopt

✅ using groq response is Based on the context documents, we need to find the information related to the Anios acquisition in Document 1. 

From Document 1, under the Anios Acquisition on February 1, 2017, it is mentioned that: "the customer relationships and acquired technologies of both acquisitions were identified as valuable intangible assets by an independent valuation firm and assigned an estimated life of 20 years by the company based on the valuation firm's estimates."

However, it does not provide the exact portion of total assets acquired that are intangible assets. But from Document 2, it mentions that "the customer relationships and acquired technologies of both acquisitions were identified as valuable intangible assets by an independent valuation firm and assigned an estimated life of 20 years by the company based on the valuation firm's estimates."

From Document 1, under the Components of the Cash Paid for Anios, it shows the cash paid for Anios and the components of such cash. However, it does not provide the portion of total assets acquired that are intangible assets.

From Document 4, it is mentioned that "the $ 123 million of acquired amortizable intangible assets includes...". But this is related to a different acquisition.

Unfortunately, we cannot find the exact portion of total assets acquired that are intangible assets for Anios from the provided context documents.

✅ using groq response is Unfortunately, the provided context documents do not contain enough information to provide a direct answer to the question of the five-year total return on the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. However, we can infer some information from the documents.

Document 1 mentions the cumulative total returns of Goldman Sachs' common stock from December 26, 2008 to December 31, 2013, but it does not explicitly state the five-year total return.

Document 7 mentions the five-year cumulative total stockholder return on Goldman Sachs' common stock from December 26, 2008 to December 28, 2013, which is based on the market price of the common stock. However, it does not provide the actual total return value.

Document 8 is not relevant to Goldman Sachs, as it discusses Snap-on Inc.'s performance.

Document 9 is also not relevant, as it discusses Snap-on Inc.'s performance.

Document 10 discusses CME Group Inc.'s performance, which is not relevant to Goldman Sachs.

Document 6 mentions the five-year total return of Goldman Sachs' common stock for the period ended December 31, 2009, but it does not provide the five-year total return for the entire period.

Document 4 mentions the total AUM inflows/outflows for Goldman Sachs for 2017, but it does not provide the five-year total return.

Document 5 mentions a summary of Level 3 financial assets, but it does not provide the five-year total return.

Document 3 mentions the cumulative total stockholder return for Goldman Sachs' common stock for the last five full fiscal years, but it does not provide the five-year total return.

Document 2 mentions the total return of Goldman Sachs' common stock for the five years ended December 31, 2014, but it does not provide the five-year total return.

Document 1 provides the cumulative total returns of Goldman Sachs' common stock from December 26, 2008 to December 31, 2013. Based on this information, it is possible to calculate the five-year total return, but it would require additional calculations and assumptions.

Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to the question of the five-year total return on the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

rates . the two-step quantitative process involved comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit 2019s carrying value , including goodwill . if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value , goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired , and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary . if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value , the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded , if any . the company 2019s goodwill

quarter to the second quarter . the change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with our long-range planning and forecasting process . we had determined that this change in accounting principle was preferable under the circumstances and believe that the change in the annual impairment testing date did not delay , accelerate , or avoid an impairment charge . while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis . the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value . if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired . to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry . at december 31 , 2017 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.7 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which consists of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics . the estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2017 . to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method . we concluded that the fair value of our non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value . these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs . management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use . since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria group , inc. , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets . marketing and advertising costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions . the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s . gaap . recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program . for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer's achieving the specified targets , and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made . for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience . changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows . employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 . benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) . we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s . gaap . these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates . we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so . as permitted by u.s . gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods . we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries .

allowances for excess and obsolete instruments . instruments in the field are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation . depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on average estimated useful lives , determined principally in reference to associated product life cycles , primarily five years . we review instruments for impairment in accordance with sfas no . 144 . depreciation of instruments is recognized as selling , general and administrative expense . goodwill 2013 we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no . 142 , 201cgoodwill and other intangible assets 201d . goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests . goodwill has been assigned to reporting units , which are consistent with our operating segments . we perform annual impairment tests by comparing each reporting unit 2019s fair value to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential impairment . we perform this test in the fourth quarter of the year . if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value , an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill . the fair value of the reporting unit and the implied fair value of goodwill are determined based upon market multiples . intangible assets 2013 we account for intangible assets in accordance with sfas no . 142 . intangible assets are initially measured at their fair value . we have determined the fair value of our intangible assets either by the fair value of the consideration exchanged for the intangible asset , or the estimated after-tax discounted cash flows expected to be generated from the intangible asset . intangible assets with an indefinite life , including certain trademarks and trade names , are not amortized . the useful lives of indefinite life intangible assets are assessed annually to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life . intangible assets with a finite life , including core and developed technology , certain trademarks and trade names , z i m m e r h o l d i n g s , i n c . 2 0 0 7 f o r m 1 0 - k a n n u a l r e p o r t notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) .', 'during 2008 , amr recorded a settlement charge totaling $ 103 million related to lump sum distributions from the company 2019s defined benefit pension plans to pilots who retired . pursuant to u.s . gaap , the use of settlement accounting is required if , for a given year , the cost of all settlements exceeds , or is expected to exceed , the sum of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension expense for a plan . under settlement accounting , unrecognized plan gains or losses must be recognized immediately in proportion to the percentage reduction of the plan 2019s projected benefit obligation . 11 . intangible assets the company has recorded international slot and route authorities of $ 708 million and $ 736 million as of december 31 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . the company considers these assets indefinite life assets and as a result , they are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired . such triggering events may include significant changes to the company 2019s network or capacity , or the implementation of open skies agreements in countries where the company operates flights . in the fourth quarter of 2010 , the company performed its annual impairment testing on international slots and routes , at which time the net carrying value was reassessed for recoverability . it was determined through this annual impairment testing that the fair value of certain international routes in latin america was less than the carrying value . thus , the company incurred an impairment charge of $ 28 million to write down the values of these and certain other slots and routes . as there is minimal market activity for the valuation of routes and international slots and landing rights , the company measures fair value with inputs using the income approach . the income approach uses valuation techniques , such as future cash flows , to convert future amounts to a single present discounted amount . the inputs utilized for these valuations are unobservable and reflect the company 2019s assumptions about market participants and what they would use to value the routes and accordingly are considered level 3 in the fair value hierarchy . the company 2019s unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available as of december 31 .', "the company evaluates the recoverability of its property , plant , and equipment when there are changes in economic circumstances or business objectives that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable . the company's evaluations include estimated future cash flows , profitability , and other factors affecting fair value . as these assumptions and estimates may change over time , it may or may not be necessary to record impairment charges . leases - the company uses its incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification as capital or operating and defines the initial lease term to include renewal options determined to be reasonably assured . the company conducts operations primarily under operating leases . many of the company's real property lease agreements contain incentives for tenant improvements , rent holidays , or rent escalation clauses . for incentives for tenant improvements , the company records a deferred rent liability and amortizes the deferred rent over the term of the lease as a reduction to rent expense . for rent holidays and rent escalation clauses during the lease term , the company records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease . for purposes of recognizing lease incentives , the company uses the date of initial possession as the commencement date , which is generally the date on which the company is given the right of access to the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for the intended use . goodwill and other intangible assets - the company performs impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 of each year and between annual impairment tests if evidence of potential impairment exists , by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations . if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value , a second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired , by comparing the estimated fair value of goodwill to its carrying value . purchased intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis or a method based on the pattern of benefits over their estimated useful lives , and the carrying value of these assets is reviewed for impairment when events indicate that a potential impairment may have occurred . equity method investments - investments in which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee but does not own a majority interest or otherwise control are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and included in other assets in its consolidated statements of financial position . the company's equity investments align strategically and are integrated with the company's operations , and therefore the company's share of the net earnings or losses of the investee is included in operating income ( loss ) . the company evaluates its equity investments for other than temporary impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may not be fully recoverable . if a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary , a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period . self-insured group medical insurance - the company maintains a self-insured group medical insurance plan . the plan is designed to provide a specified level of coverage for employees and their dependents . estimated liabilities .", 'long-lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets the company reviews property , plant , and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles , excluding goodwill , for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable . recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate . if property , plant , and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired , the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value . for the three years ended september 27 , 2003 , the company has made no material adjustments to its long-lived assets , except those made in connection with the restructuring actions described in note 5 . the company adopted sfas no . 142 , goodwill and other intangible assets , in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 . sfas no . 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized , but instead be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired . prior to fiscal 2002 , goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life . the company completed its transitional goodwill impairment test as of october 1 , 2001 , and its annual goodwill impairment tests at august 30 , 2003 and august 30 , 2002 , respectively , and found no impairment . the company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure . for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment , goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit . sfas no . 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no . 144 , accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of . the company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years . foreign currency translation the company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-u.s . functional currency subsidiaries into u.s . dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period . revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period . gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in "accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) " in shareholders\' equity . the company 2019s foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that use the u.s . dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period , and inventories , property , and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates . gains and losses from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the company 2019s results of operations . revenue recognition net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products ( hardware , software , and peripherals ) , and extended warranty and support contracts . the company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards , including statement of position ( sop ) no . 97-2 , software revenue recognition , as amended , and securities and exchange commission ( sec ) staff accounting bulletin ( sab ) no . 101 , revenue recognition in financial statements . the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists , delivery has occurred , the sales price is fixed or determinable , and collection is probable . product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred . for most of the company 2019s product sales , these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped . for online sales to individuals , for some sales to education customers in the united states , and for certain other sales , the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit . if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not , or is presumed to not be , fixed and determinable , revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable . revenue from extended warranty and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the warranty and support periods . these contracts typically include extended phone support , certain repairs , web-based support resources , diagnostic tools , and extend the company 2019s one-year basic limited parts and labor warranty. .', 'improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset . impairment of long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present , the company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets , other than goodwill , in relation to the operating performance and future cash flows or the appraised values of the underlying assets . in accordance with sfas 144 , 201caccounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets , 201d the company reviews for impairment stores open more than two years for which current cash flows from operations are negative . impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease . the company 2019s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and difficult to predict . if a long-lived asset is found to be impaired , the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset 2019s fair value . the fair value is estimated based primarily upon future cash flows ( discounted at the company 2019s credit adjusted risk-free rate ) or other reasonable estimates of fair market value . assets to be disposed of are adjusted to the fair value less the cost to sell if less than the book value . the company recorded impairment charges included in sg&a expense of approximately $ 0.2 million in the 2007 predecessor period , $ 9.4 million in 2006 and $ 0.6 million in 2005 to reduce the carrying value of certain of its stores 2019 assets as deemed necessary due to negative sales trends and cash flows at these locations . the majority of the 2006 charges were recorded pursuant to certain strategic initiatives discussed in note 3 . goodwill and other intangible assets the company amortizes intangible assets over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite . amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows , and , if impaired , written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values . intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment and written down to fair value as required . no impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented. .', '11 . other assets the company accounts for its interest in pennymac as an equity method investment , which is included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition . the carrying value and fair value of the company 2019s interest ( approximately 20% ( 20 % ) or 16 million shares and non-public units ) was approximately $ 342 million and $ 348 million , respectively , at december 31 , 2017 and approximately $ 301 million and $ 259 million , respectively , at december 31 , 2016 . the fair value of the company 2019s interest reflected the pennymac stock price at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively ( a level 1 input ) . the fair value of the company 2019s interest in the non-public units held of pennymac is based on the stock price of the
