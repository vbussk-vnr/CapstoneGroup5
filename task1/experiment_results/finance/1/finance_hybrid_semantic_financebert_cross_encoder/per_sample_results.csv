However, we can use the data from Document 1 to estimate the cumulative total return of Cadence Design Systems Inc. from 2010 to 2011. The graph in Document 1 shows the cumulative 5-year total stockholder return on Cadence Design Systems Inc. relative to the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ Composite Index and the S&P 400 Information Technology Index.

From the graph in Document 1, we can see that the value of the investment in Cadence Design Systems Inc. on January 3, 2011, is $134.11 (which is the value after 5 years from January 2, 2010).

To estimate the rate of return, we need to know the value of the investment on December 31, 2010, and the value on January 3, 2011. However, this information is not provided in the graph.

We can try to estimate the rate of return using the data from other documents. Document 4 describes the increase in net sales in 2011 compared to 2010, but it does not provide the"

Total US Airways personnel: 32800 (US Airways) + 18900 (US Airways regional carriers) = 51700

The ratio of the total American personnel to US Airways personnel is 94400 / 51700 = 1.83 or approximately 2:1."
finqa_6634,what portion of total assets acquired of anios are intangible assets?,0.3375,0.0625,0.18518518518518517,0.0,"To answer the question, we need to look at the table in Document 4 that shows the components of the total assets acquired of Anios.

Total assets acquired = $19427
Customer-related intangible assets = $4091

To find the portion of intangible assets, we need to divide the customer-related intangible assets by the total assets acquired and multiply by 100.

(Intangible assets / Total assets acquired) × 100
= ($4091 / $19427) × 100
= 21%

So, approximately 21% of the total assets acquired of Anios are intangible assets."

According to Document 2, the total goodwill as of December 2016 was $3.67 billion.

According to Document 8, the total goodwill as of December 2017 is not directly provided but we can find the change in goodwill for each segment. However, the total goodwill for 2017 is not provided. We can only find the total goodwill for 2016 which is $3.67 billion.

We can find the total goodwill for 2017 in Document 2 which states that goodwill of $3.67 billion as of both December 2017 and December 2016.

However, if we go to Document 10, we can find the answer to the question. Document 10 is not useful to calculate the total goodwill for 2017, but we can use the information in Document 2 which states that goodwill of $3.67 billion as of both December 2017 and December 2016.
