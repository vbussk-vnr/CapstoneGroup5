- Balance at end of year 2017: $38.9 million
- Balance at beginning of year 2016: $46.7 million
- Balance at end of year 2016: $44.0 million

The total carrying amount of goodwill at the beginning of 2017 is $44.0 million (Document 10) and at the end of 2017 is $38.9 million. 

The total change in goodwill from 2016 to 2017 is $44.0 - $38.9 = $5.1 million.

The percentage change in the total carrying amount of goodwill from 2016 to 2017 is ($5.1 million / $44.0 million) * 100 = -11.59%
