From Document 1, we can see that the column headers are American, US Airways, Wholly-owned Regional Carriers, and Total. 

The row headers are Pilots, Flight Attendants, Maintenance Personnel, Fleet Service Personnel, Passenger Service Personnel, Administrative and Other, and Total.

To find the total personnel for American and US Airways, we need to sum the values in the American and US Airways columns for each row.

For American:
- Pilots: 8600
- Flight Attendants: 15900
- Maintenance Personnel: 10800
- Fleet Service Personnel: 8600
- Passenger Service Personnel: 9100
- Administrative and Other: 8600

Total American personnel: 8600 + 15900 + 10800 + 8600 + 9100 + 8600 = 61600

The portion of total assets acquired that are intangible assets is ($333.8 / $473.6) * 100% ≈ 70.6%.

According to the document, the aggregate net asset values of the direct lending collateral pools were:

- $150 billion in 2007
- $85 billion in 2008
- $85 billion in 2009

To find the percent change between 2007 and 2008, we can use the following formula:

Percent change = ((New value - Old value) / Old value) x 100

Plugging in the values, we get:

Percent change = ((85 - 150) / 150) x 100
Percent change = (-65 / 150) x 100
Percent change = -43.33%

So, the aggregate net asset values of the direct lending collateral pools decreased by 43.33% between 2007 and 2008."

But, Document 5 mentions that the interest and penalties of $260 and $214 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, are recorded as a component of income tax expense. And Document 7 mentions that as of March 31, 2008, no penalties have been accrued, which is consistent with the company's discussions with states in connection with the company's voluntary disclosure plan.

Since there is no information available about accrued interest and penalties for the year 2013, we cannot accurately calculate the percentual decrease during 2012 and 2013.

However, assuming that the interest and penalties for 2012 are $260, and for 2011 are $214, we can calculate the decrease as follows:

From Document 8, we can see that the total net unrealized gains and losses are as follows:

- 2005: -$231 million
- 2004: $92 million

To find the average net unrealized investment gains, we need to first find the net unrealized gains for each year. The net unrealized gains are the negative of the total net unrealized gains and losses:

- 2006: $224 million
- 2005: $231 million
- 2004: -$92 million

Now, we can find the average net unrealized investment gains by adding up the net unrealized gains and dividing by the number of years:

Average net unrealized investment gains = ($224 million + $231 million - $92 million) / 3
= $363 million / 3
= $121 million

So, the average net unrealized investment gains for the period is $121 million."

* Document 3 mentions Abiomed's stock performance, but it doesn't compare it with the NASDAQ composite index.

If you're looking for a more detailed comparison, you might want to search for other context documents that provide more information on Abiomed's stock performance and its comparison with the NASDAQ composite index.

However, I can suggest a possible answer based on the information provided in Document 1:

In Document 1, the performance graph shows that Abiomed's stock performance was higher than the NASDAQ composite index for some years, but lower for other years. Therefore, it's difficult to say whether Abiomed outperformed the NASDAQ composite index or not.

The increase in net income in millions without employee severance costs in 2004 and 2005 would be:

Increase in net income in 2005 (without employee severance costs in 2005) = Net income in 2005 - Employee severance costs in 2005

In 2010, cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities including discontinued operations was $ 515.2 million.

To find the percentage change, we use the following formula:

Percentage change = ((New value - Old value) / Old value) x 100

Plugging in the values, we get:

Percentage change = ((515.2 - 559.7) / 559.7) x 100
Percentage change = (-44.5 / 559.7) x 100
Percentage change = -7.95%

So, the percentage change in cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities including discontinued operations between 2009 and 2010 is -7.95%.
