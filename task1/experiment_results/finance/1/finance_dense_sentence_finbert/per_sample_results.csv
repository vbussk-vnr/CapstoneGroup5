Shares (in thousands) Fair Value Price per Share
Beginning balance (as of 2011)  1, 592, 970 
Earned (in 2012)  950, 470 
Vested in 2011  159, 970 
Vested in 2012  53, 990 
Cancelled  2, 706 
Ending balance (as of 2012)  2, 653, 680

To find the percent change in the number of shares that was not vested from 2011 to 2012, we can calculate as follows:

Percent change = ((Ending balance - Beginning balance) / Beginning balance) x 100
= ((2,653,680 - 1,592,970) / 1,592,970) x 100
= 66.3%

So, in 2012, the percent change in the number of shares that was not vested was approximately 66.3% increase."

However, based on the information in Document 4, we can see the weighted-average fair value of restricted stock granted during the year for 2008, 2009, and 2010:

- 2008: $4979218
- 2009: $28269983

To calculate the percent of the change, we can use the following formula:

((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100

Plugging in the values, we get:

((28269983 - 4979218) / 4979218) * 100
= ((23290765) / 4979218) * 100

So, the percent of the change of the weighted-average fair value at grant date from 2008 to 2009 is approximately 466.9%."
finqa_6736,what was the percentage decline in the operating loss from 2007 to 2008,0.09782608695652174,0.010869565217391304,0.1111111111111111,0.0,"To find the percentage decline in the operating loss from 2007 to 2008, we need to first find the difference in the operating loss between the two years.

Operating loss in 2007: $1.2 billion
Operating loss in 2008: $2.2 billion

Since the operating loss increased from 2007 to 2008, we will calculate the percentage increase in the operating loss.

Percentage increase = ((New value - Old value) / Old value) × 100
= (($2.2 billion - $1.2 billion) / $1.2 billion) × 100
= ($1 billion / $1.2 billion) × 100
= 83.33%

So, the operating loss increased by 83.33% from 2007 to 2008.

Since the question asks for the percentage decline in the operating loss, which is actually an increase, we will express it as a decline by taking the negative of the percentage increase.

Percentage decline = -83.33%

However, to express this as a percentage decline from the original operating loss in 2007, we will calculate the percentage decline from the original operating loss in 2007 to the new operating loss in 2008."
