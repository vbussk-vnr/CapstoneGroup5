According to the graph, the market value of an investment in Cadence Design Systems Inc. at December 31, 2010, was $100.00, and at December 31, 2011, it was $173.62.

To calculate the rate of return, we can use the formula:

Rate of Return = (Ending Value / Beginning Value) - 1

Plugging in the values, we get:

Rate of Return = ($173.62 / $100.00) - 1
Rate of Return ≈ 0.7362 or 73.62%

So, the rate of return for an investment in Cadence Design Systems Inc. from 2010 to 2011 was approximately 73.62%."

Now, let's add up the intangible assets:
$13536 million (Goodwill) + $4091 million (Customer-related intangible assets) + $1031 million (Contract-based intangible assets) = $18658 million

To find the portion of total assets acquired that are intangible assets, we divide the total intangible assets by the total assets acquired:

From this, we can calculate the pre-tax share-based compensation cost in 2010 as $18.1 million. However, we cannot determine the after-tax share-based compensation cost in 2010 without the tax rate or additional information.

To find the after-tax share-based compensation cost, we would need to know the tax rate or have more information about the income tax benefit. However, based on the provided information, we can calculate the after-tax share-based compensation cost as follows:

Pre-tax share-based compensation cost = $18.1 million
Income tax benefit = $6.3 million (note that the income tax benefit is in parentheses, indicating that it is a credit, which is opposite of a debit)

Since the income tax benefit is a credit, we need to subtract it from the pre-tax share-based compensation cost to find the after-tax share-based compensation cost.

After-tax share-based compensation cost = Pre-tax share-based compensation cost - Income tax benefit
= $18.1 million - ( $6.3 million )
= $18.1 million + $6.3 million
= $24.4 million

However, this is not a correct calculation. The income tax benefit is a credit, so we need to subtract it from the pre-tax share-based compensation cost, not add it. 

After-tax share-based compensation cost = Pre-tax share-based compensation cost - Income tax benefit
= $18.1 million - $6.3 million
= $11.8 million"

Additions for tax positions of prior years: $5
Reductions for tax positions of prior years: -$4

As of March 31, 2008, no penalties have been accrued which is consistent with the company's discussions with states in connection with the company's voluntary disclosure plan.

Unfortunately, there is no information about the liabilities for accrued interest and penalties in Document 9. However, I can suggest a possible answer based on the available information.

Since the amount of accrued interest and penalties was not significant in 2007 and there were no penalties accrued as of March 31, 2008, and the interest and penalties as of December 31, 2012 and 2013 are $260 and $242, respectively. 

This represents a decrease of $18 in 2013 compared to 2012. 

The percentual decrease can be calculated as (18/260) * 100% = 6.9%."
finqa_6667,what portion of the total estimated purchase price is paid in cash?,0.01,0.01,1.0,1.0,"To calculate the portion of the total estimated purchase price paid in cash, we'll need to refer to Document 2, which provides the details on the total estimated purchase price and the amounts paid in various forms.

According to Document 2, the breakdown of the total estimated purchase price is as follows:

- Cash portion of consideration: $2,094,800
- Fair value of securities issued: $3,671,500
- Fair value of vested options exchanged: $241,400
- Fair value of Cytyc 2019s outstanding convertible notes: $125,000
- Direct acquisition costs: $24,200

The total estimated purchase price is $6,157,900.

To calculate the portion paid in cash, we'll divide the cash portion of consideration by the total estimated purchase price:

($2,094,800 ÷ $6,157,900) ≈ 0.34 or 34%

So, approximately 34% of the total estimated purchase price is paid in cash."

According to Document 2, during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, the company recorded net losses associated with the sales of certain non-core towers and other assets, as well as impairment charges to write-down certain assets to net realizable value after an indicator of impairment had been identified.

The net losses for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 were approximately $10.5 million, $7.1 million, and $2.0 million, respectively.

To find the percent of change in the recorded net losses from 2007 to 2008, we can use the following formula:

((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) x 100

Plugging in the values, we get:

((10.5 - 7.1) / 7.1) x 100
= (3.4 / 7.1) x 100

However, it does provide information about rent expense in Document 2, which states that rent expense was $216 million, $205 million, and $168 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. 

To calculate the percentage rent decrease between 2007 and 2008, we can use the following formula:

((168 - 205) / 168) * 100

* Net tangible assets acquired as of May 2, 2006: $23,700
* In-process research and development: $600
* Developed technology and know-how: $1,900
* Customer relationship: $800
* Trade name: $400
* Deferred income taxes: -$3,000
* Goodwill: $6,900

However, it is not clear if this purchase price and its allocation are related to Anios. We can refer to Document 1, which mentions the purchase price of Anios as $798.3 million.

To find the portion of Anios' purchasing price related to goodwill, we can refer to Document 10, which provides the components and allocation of the purchase price for a different acquisition. According to Document 10, the allocation is as follows:

* Goodwill: $13,536
* Customer-related intangible assets: $4,091
* Contract-based intangible assets: $1,031
* Property and equipment: $267
* Other current assets: $502
* Total assets acquired: $19,427
* Current liabilities: -$2,347
* Minority interest in equity of subsidiary: -$486
* Net assets acquired: $16,594

However, this information is not related to Anios, and we still cannot determine the portion of Anios' purchasing price related to goodwill.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain enough information to determine the portion of Anios' purchasing price related to goodwill."

- 2005: $82 million
- 2006: $67 million

To find the percentage of lease payments that will be paid in the first year, we need more information about the percentage of total lease payments paid in the first year, but this is not available in the provided documents.

If we only consider the available information for years 2003 to 2007, we can calculate the percentage of total lease payments paid in the first year. 

Total lease payments from 2003 to 2007 are: $94 + $94 + $82 + $67 + $62 = $399 million.

Total lease payments beyond 2007 are: $79 million.

Total lease payments for the 5 years: $399 + $79 = $478 million.

Now, if we consider the next 5 years, we can find the percentage of total lease payments paid in the first year.

Document 1: It assumes $100 was invested on December 31, 2007, and that all dividends were reinvested.

Document 9: The table in Document 9 shows the cumulative total returns in dollars of the S&P 500 Index for the five years from December 31, 2007, to December 31, 2012.

The value of a $100 investment in the S&P 500 Index as of December 31, 2008, is as follows:

- 2008: $100 (initial investment) + $X (dividends) = $Y (total value)
- 2009: $Y + $X (dividends) = $Z (total value)
- 2010: $Z + $X (dividends) = $A (total value)
- 2011: $A + $X (dividends) = $B (total value)
- 2012: $B + $X (dividends) = $C (total value)

The actual values for 2009-2012 are not provided in the question. However, since we are asked about the return on investment for S&P 500 from 2007 to 2008, we can calculate the return as follows:

Return on Investment (ROI) = (Total Value on December 31, 2008 - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment

Since the value of the investment on December 31, 2008, is not explicitly stated, we cannot calculate the exact ROI for S&P 500 from 2007 to 2008. However, for other periods, such as from 2007 to 2012, the ROI can be calculated.

For example, for the period from 2007 to 2012:

Return on Investment (ROI) = (Total Value on December 31, 2012 - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment
= ($C - $100) / $100
= ($C - 100) / 100

Since the exact values for 2009-2012 are not provided, we cannot calculate the exact ROI for the specified period.

According to document 3, the total square footage of the office in Alpharetta, Georgia is 254,000 square feet.

Since we do not have any information on the portion of the office that was leased or sublet, we cannot calculate the exact percentage of the office that was not yet leased. 

We can, however, calculate the percentage of the total square footage in Alpharetta, Georgia that the company owns.

Percentage of owned square footage = (166,000 / 254,000) * 100 

Percentage of owned square footage = 65.43% 

This means that the company owned approximately 65.43% of the total square footage in Alpharetta, Georgia, and therefore the remaining percentage was leased or sublet.

As of December 31, 2009, the net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities was -$1,636 million.

To find the percent change, we use the following formula:

Percent change = (New value - Old value) / Old value * 100

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

Percent change = (-1,636 - (-5,205)) / (-5,205) * 100
Percent change = (-1,636 + 5,205) / 5,205 * 100
Percent change = 3,569 / 5,205 * 100
Percent change ≈ 68.6%

However, the percent change is calculated as a decrease in the net unrealized loss, so we express it as a negative number:

Percent change ≈ -68.6%

This means that the net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities decreased by approximately 68.6% between 2008 and 2009."

Initial Value = 100 (as stated in the document)
Final Value = 99.02 (as stated in the document for March 31, 2009)

However, to find the effective income tax rate in 2017, we need to look at Document 1, which states that the effective income tax rate for 2017 is 13.7% (13.7% in parentheses).

To find the difference between the statutory U.S. rate and the effective income tax rate in 2017, we can subtract the effective income tax rate from the statutory U.S. rate: 

35.0% (statutory U.S. rate) - 13.7% (effective income tax rate) = 21.3%

However, Document 1 also shows that 420 shares were granted between may 31, 2009 and may 31, 2010. Therefore, the total number of non-vested shares as of may 31, 2010 is 762 + 420 - 49 = 1133.

The fair value of the non-vested shares as of may 31, 2009 is $42, and the fair value of the 420 shares granted between may 31, 2009 and may 31, 2010 is 420 * $42 = $17,640. The fair value of the 49 shares that were not vested as of may 31, 2010 is 49 * $42 = $2,058.
