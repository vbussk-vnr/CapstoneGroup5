In this document, it is stated that the total assets acquired were $473.6 million, and the identifiable intangible assets were $252.0 million (customer relationships) + $65.7 million (trademarks) + $16.1 million (other technology). 

Total identifiable intangible assets = $252.0 million + $65.7 million + $16.1 million = $333.8 million.

To find the portion of total assets acquired that are intangible assets, we can divide the total identifiable intangible assets by the total assets acquired.

Portion of total assets acquired that are intangible assets = (Total identifiable intangible assets) / (Total assets acquired)
= $333.8 million / $473.6 million
= 0.706 or approximately 70.6%"

To calculate the percent change in the aggregate net asset values of the direct lending collateral pools between 2007 and 2008, we need to find the difference in the values and divide it by the original value, then multiply by 100.

The percent change is ((85 - 85) / 85) * 100 = 0%.

From the document, we can see that the cash dividends paid per common share in 2006 was $1.08 and in 2007 was $1.11.

Now, we can calculate the percentage change:

Percentage change = ((New value - Old value) / Old value) * 100
Percentage change = (($1.11 - $1.08) / $1.08) * 100
Percentage change = ($0.03 / $1.08) * 100

The change in net losses from 2007 to 2008 is $ 10.5 million - $ 7.1 million = $ 3.4 million.

To find the percent of change, we need to divide the change in net losses ($ 3.4 million) by the net losses in 2007 ($ 7.1 million) and multiply by 100.

To calculate the percentage rent increase, we can use the following formula:

((New Rent - Old Rent) / Old Rent) * 100

Applying this formula, we get:

((205 - 168) / 168) * 100 = (37 / 168) * 100 ≈ 22%

Document 9 mentions that as of December 31, 2008, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $148.8 million. 

Document 8 states that as of December 31, 2007, Aon had recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $148.8 million is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer that the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits from 2007 to 2008 is related to the settlements and discussions with the IRS.

However, Document 10 provides the information we need to calculate the increase in unrecognized tax benefits during 2007 and 2008. According to Document 10, as of September 30, 2017 and September 30,"

- Net income in 2006 was not provided in the documents.

According to Document 4, the net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2008, was -$5,205 million, and as of December 31, 2009, it was -$1,636 million.

To find the percent change, we can use the formula:

Percent change = (New value - Old value) / Old value * 100

Plugging in the values:

Percent change = (-$1,636 - (-$5,205)) / (-$5,205) * 100
Percent change = (-$1,636 + $5,205) / (-$5,205) * 100
Percent change = $3,569 / (-$5,205) * 100
Percent change = -68.6%

Therefore, the net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities decreased by 68.6% between 2008 and 2009."

However, the beginning balance of $266.9 seems to be incorrect, as the balance at the end of the previous year ($134.8) is lower than the beginning balance of the current year. But this is due to the ""decreases as a result of tax positions taken during a prior year"" which is $156.3.

So for the year 2007, the balance increased by 7.9 (increases as a result of tax positions taken during a prior year). However, we need to calculate the percentual increase.

Plugging in the values, we get:

((166.15 - 142.94) / 142.94) * 100
= (23.21 / 142.94) * 100
= 16.23%

Therefore, the percentage growth of the 5 year-cumulative total return for the 2018 peer group from 2016 to 2017 was 16.23%."

According to Document 2: ""during 2004, we generated after-tax gains of $ 16.5 million from the sale of six properties compared to $ 9.6 million from the sale of four properties in 2003.""

The ratio of after-tax gains in 2004 compared to 2003 is therefore:

($16.5 million / $9.6 million) = 1.72 or 172%

So, the after-tax gains in 2004 were 172% of the after-tax gains in 2003."
finqa_6281,in 2015 what was the percent of the total operating revenues associated with agriculture products,0.018691588785046728,0.009345794392523364,0.5,1.0,"To find the percent of the total operating revenues associated with agricultural products in 2015, we first need to find the total operating revenues for 2015 and then find the revenues associated with agricultural products in 2015.

Document 2 shows us the total operating revenues for 2015 as $21813 million.

Document 2 also shows us the revenues associated with agricultural products in 2015 as $3581 million.

We can now calculate the percent of the total operating revenues associated with agricultural products in 2015 as follows:

Percentage = (Revenues associated with agricultural products / Total operating revenues) x 100
= ($3581 / $21813) x 100
= 16.37%

So, in 2015, the percent of the total operating revenues associated with agricultural products was approximately 16.37%."

However, it is mentioned that the performance period had accelerated and the maximum performance pool of $49250000, taking into account forfeitures, had been earned as of June 8, 2006. This implies that the entire amount of $49250000 was put into the maximum performance pool before December 31, 2007.

It is worth noting that the 2006 outperformance plan's performance criteria were not met, and no LTI units were earned under this plan."

However, the question asks about the total pretax gains from 2006 to 2007, but Document 1 only mentions 2007.

Document 1 states: ""citigroup recorded a $ 534 million ( pretax ) gain on its holdings of visa international shares primarily recognized in the consumer banking business."" However, it does not mention Mastercard shares.

There is no information in any of the other context documents that mentions the total pretax gains for the sale of Mastercard shares from 2006 to 2007.

As of December 2012, collateral posted was $24296 million.
As of December 2013, collateral posted was $18178 million.

To find the percentage change, we will use the following formula:

((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100

Plugging in the values, we get:

((18178 - 24296) / 24296) * 100
= (-6118 / 24296) * 100
= -0.252 or -25.2%

So, the percentage change in collateral posted from 2012 to 2013 was a decrease of 25.2%."
