finqa_6634,what portion of total assets acquired of anios are intangible assets?,0.2777777777777778,0.2962962962962963,1.0,1.0,"To find the portion of total assets acquired of Anios that are intangible assets, we need to refer to Document 2. In this document, the total assets acquired of Anios are $473.6 million, and the identifiable intangible assets are $252.0 million (for customer relationships), $65.7 million (for trademarks), and $16.1 million (for other technology). 

The total value of these intangible assets is $252.0 + $65.7 + $16.1 = $333.8 million.

The portion of total assets acquired that are intangible assets is then calculated as:
(intangible assets / total assets acquired) * 100%
= ($333.8 / $473.6) * 100%
= 70.5%

So, approximately 70.5% of the total assets acquired of Anios are intangible assets."
