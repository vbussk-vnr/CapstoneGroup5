✅ using groq response is The rate of return in Cadence Design Systems Inc. from 2010 to 2011 cannot be determined based on the information provided.

The only information that could potentially be used to determine the rate of return is found in Document 2, which shows a stockholder return performance graph comparing the cumulative 5-year total stockholder return on Cadence Design Systems Inc.'s common stock relative to the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ Composite Index and the S&P 400 Information Technology Index. However, this document does not provide a direct calculation of the rate of return for the period from 2010 to 2011.

Document 2 shows that the cumulative 5-year total stockholder return for Cadence Design Systems Inc. as of January 3, 2015, was compared to the cumulative 5-year total return of the NASDAQ Composite Index and the S&P 400 Information Technology Index as of the same date. However, it does not provide information on the rate of return for the specific period of 2010 to 2011.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the question based on the information provided.

✅ using groq response is To find the ratio of American personnel to US Airways personnel, we need to calculate the total number of personnel for each airline. 

From Document 2, we can see that the total number of personnel for American is 61,600, and for US Airways is 32,800. 

The ratio of American personnel to US Airways personnel is: 
61,600 / 32,800 ≈ 1.88 

So, the ratio of American personnel to US Airways personnel is approximately 1.88:1.

✅ using groq response is To answer the question, we need to analyze the given context documents. 

From the Document 1, we can't see which company is referred to as "anios", but we can find information about intangible assets in the Document 9, where Anios is mentioned. The Document 9 shows the following information about intangible assets:

["identifiable intangible assets:", "", "customer relationships", "1800", "trademarks", "890", "technology", "215", "other noncurrent assets ( 2 )", "344"]

The total identifiable intangible assets are not explicitly given. However, we know from the Document 9 that the total net assets acquired by Anios are $ 2217 and the total consideration transferred is $ 4932.

Document 1 doesn't have the specific information about Anios, but Document 9 provides us with the necessary information.

From the Document 9, we can calculate the total identifiable intangible assets acquired by Anios:
Total identifiable intangible assets acquired by Anios =  $1800 + $890 + $215 + $344
= $ 3249

Document 9 does not explicitly mention total intangible assets. However, intangible assets in Document 9 are: identifiable intangible

✅ using groq response is Based on the context documents, specifically Document 6 and Document 5, we can calculate the five-year total return on the Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

From Document 6, we have the following data:

- December 26, 2008: $100
- December 31, 2009: $224.98
- December 31, 2010: $226.19
- December 31, 2011: $123.05
- December 31, 2012: $176.42
- December 31, 2013: $248.36

To calculate the five-year total return, we can use the following formula:

Total Return = (Current Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value * 100

Substituting the values:

Total Return = (($248.36 - $100) / $100) * 100 = 148.36%

However, to get the actual five-year cumulative total return, we can use the data from Document 5 which provides a more detailed breakdown of the values.

From Document 5, we have the following data for Goldman Sachs Group Inc.:

- December 31, 2008: $100.00
