From Document 2, the total personnel numbers for American Airlines are:
- Pilots: 8600
- Flight Attendants: 15900
- Maintenance Personnel: 10800
- Fleet Service Personnel: 8600
- Passenger Service Personnel: 9100
- Administrative and Other: 8600

From Document 2, the total personnel numbers for US Airways are:

- Maintenance Personnel: 3600
- Fleet Service Personnel: 6200
- Passenger Service Personnel: 6100
- Administrative and Other: 4800
Total: 32800

Now, let's calculate the ratio of American Airlines personnel to US Airways personnel:
Total American personnel: 61600
Total US Airways personnel: 32800
Ratio = Total American personnel / Total US Airways personnel
Ratio = 61600 / 32800
Ratio ≈ 1.88

So, the ratio of the total American personnel to US Airways personnel is approximately 1.88."

According to Document 1, the total assets acquired is $19427 and intangible assets are the sum of goodwill, customer-related intangible assets, and contract-based intangible assets. 

Intangible Assets = Goodwill + Customer-related intangible assets + Contract-based intangible assets
Intangible Assets = $13536 + $4091 + $1031
Intangible Assets = $18658

Now, we need to find the portion of total assets acquired that are intangible assets. 

Portion of intangible assets = (Intangible Assets / Total assets acquired) * 100
Portion of intangible assets = ($18658 / $19427) * 100
Portion of intangible assets ≈ 96%

So, about 96% of the total assets acquired of Anios are intangible assets."

The balance at the end of 2017 is $38.9 million.

However, the total carrying amount of goodwill is the sum of the beginning and end of year balances, minus additions charged to expense and plus accounts written-off.

To find the total carrying amount of goodwill for 2016, we calculate: $44.0 (beginning balance) + $20.4 (additions charged to expense) - $23.1 (accounts written-off) = $41.3 million.

The percent change can be calculated as follows:

((2008 balance - 2007 balance) / 2007 balance) * 100
= (($85 billion - $150 billion) / $150 billion) * 100
= (-$65 billion / $150 billion) * 100

Document 5 states that the total balance in the table above does not include interest and penalties of $260 and $214 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

To calculate the percentual decrease, we will first find the decrease in interest and penalties from 2011 to 2012:

In 2008, the net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities was -$5,650 million.
In 2009, the net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities was -$2,238 million.

To find the percent change, we can use the following formula:

Percent Change = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100

Plugging in the values we get:

Percent Change = ((-$2,238 million - (-$5,650 million)) / (-$5,650 million)) * 100
Percent Change = (($3,412 million) / (-$5,650 million)) * 100

Document 1 does provide the total number of route miles in 2005: 32039 (main line and branch line route miles).

Since the main line miles are not specified separately for 2006, we can estimate the main line miles in 2006 by comparing the total route miles in 2006 to the total route miles in 2005.

To find the percent of the stock issue costs to the company proceeds, we will divide the stock issue costs by the company proceeds and multiply by 100:

However, to get the total contractual obligations as of a specific date we will use the data from Document 7, Document 5, and Document 1. The most comprehensive data on contractual obligations is from Document 7, which is for December 31, and we can use the total contractual obligations from the Document 7, and the capital lease obligation from Document 7. 

Using the data from Document 7:

Total contractual obligations = $13208 million
Capital lease obligations = $230 million

Percentage due to capital lease obligations = (Capital lease obligations / Total contractual obligations) * 100

= 1.74%

Therefore, approximately 1.74% of the total contractual obligations are due to capital lease obligations."

To find the percentage decline, we can use the following formula:

Percentage decline = ((-$1.201 billion - -$2.199 billion) / -$1.201 billion) * 100

The difference between the statutory U.S. rate and the effective income tax rate in 2017 is 35.0% - 13.7% = 21.3%.

((134 - 63) / 134) * 100 = ((71) / 134) * 100 = 52.99%

However, this is the percentual decrease. The question asks for the percentual increase. Since the balance decreased by 52.99%, we need to subtract this from 100% to get the percentual increase:

finqa_6439,what amount did the compensation committee put into the maximum performance pool between jan 1 2006 and dec 31 2007?,0.16326530612244897,0.01020408163265306,0.0625,0.0,"Based on the provided context documents, specifically Document 2, it is mentioned that in April 2007, the compensation committee determined that under the terms of the 2003 outperformance plan, as of March 31, 2007, the performance hurdles had been met and the maximum performance pool of $22,825,000, taking into account forfeitures, was established.

However, this question asks for the amount put into the maximum performance pool between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2007. Since the performance hurdles were met in April 2007 and the performance period started in April 2003, it is likely that the performance results for 2006 and the first quarter of 2007 contributed to the maximum performance pool.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specify the exact amount contributed to the maximum performance pool between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2007. The information provided in Document 2 only mentions that the performance hurdles were met in April 2007, resulting in a maximum performance pool of $22,825,000."

Document 8 provides the following information for the non-vested shares as of may 31, 2010: 
- The total number of non-vested shares is 713 (in thousands).
- The weighted average grant-date fair value is $42.

To calculate the total fair value, we multiply the total number of shares by the weighted average grant-date fair value:

713,000 shares * $42/share = $29,946,000

So, the total fair value of non-vested shares as of may 31, 2010 is $29,946,000."
finqa_7255,what was the total pretax gains in millions for the sale so mastercard shares from 2006 to 2007?,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,1.0,0.0,"Based on the context documents, I cannot find information about the sale of Mastercard shares from 2006 to 2007. However, I can find information about the global cards segment in Document 1:

Document 1:
[[""in millions of dollars"", ""2007 pretax total"", ""2007 after-tax total"", ""2006 pretax total"", ""2006 after-tax total""], [""global cards"", ""$ 466"", ""$ 296"", ""$ 94"", ""$ 59""], [""consumer banking"", ""96"", ""59"", ""27"", ""18""], [""icg"", ""19"", ""12"", ""2"", ""1""], [""total"", ""$ 581"", ""$ 367"", ""$ 123"", ""$ 78""]]

The global cards segment's pretax total in 2006 was $94 million and in 2007 was $466 million. 

To find the total pretax gains, subtract the 2006 pretax total from the 2007 pretax total: 

$466 million - $94 million = $372 million

Therefore, the total pretax gains for the global cards segment from 2006 to 2007 were $372 million."
finqa_7300,what was the percentage change in collateral posted from 2012 to 2013?,0.02857142857142857,0.014285714285714285,0.5,1.0,"To find the percentage change in collateral posted from 2012 to 2013, we need to look at the numbers in Document 8.

As of December 2012, the collateral posted was $24296 million (Document 7).
As of December 2013, the collateral posted was $18178 million (Document 8).

To find the percentage change, we can use the formula: ((new value - old value) / old value) * 100
= ((18178 - 24296) / 24296) * 100
= (-6128 / 24296) * 100
= -25.23%

So, the collateral posted decreased by 25.23% from 2012 to 2013."
