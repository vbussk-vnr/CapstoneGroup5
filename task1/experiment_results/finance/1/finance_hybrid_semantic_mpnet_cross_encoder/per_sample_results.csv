The total carrying amount of goodwill in 2016 is $3.67 billion and the total carrying amount of goodwill in 2017 is also $3.67 billion.

Document 4 shows that the aggregate net asset value of the direct lending collateral pools was $150 billion in 2007 and $85 billion in both 2008 and 2009.

To find the percent change between 2007 and 2008, we can use the following formula:

Percent change = ((New value - Old value) / Old value) x 100

Substituting the values:

Percent change = ((85 - 150) / 150) x 100
Percent change = (-65 / 150) x 100
Percent change = -43.33%

So, the aggregate net asset values of the direct lending collateral pools decreased by 43.33% between 2007 and 2008."

Document 2 mentions that the company announced an increase in the quarterly cash dividend by 11.1% (11.1%) to $0.30 per share ($1.20 per share per year) in 2007.

However, to find the percentage change, we need to calculate the difference and divide it by the original value.

Percentage change = ((New value - Original value) / Original value) * 100
= (($1.11 - $1.08) / $1.08) * 100

Before-tax share-based compensation cost = Net share-based compensation cost + Income tax benefit

According to Document 7, the net sales for 2008 and 2007 are not provided, but we do know that the net loss for 2008 is comprised of net losses from asset sales and other impairments of $ 10.7 million, offset by gains from asset sales of $ 0.2 million. However, Document 3 provides the information we need. 

According to Document 3, the net losses associated with the sales of certain non-core towers and other assets for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are:

- $ 10.5 million for 2008 (Document 3)
- $ 7.1 million for 2007 (Document 3)

The percent of the change in the recorded net losses from 2007 to 2008 can be found using the formula: ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100
= ((10.5 - 7.1) / 7.1) * 100
= (3.4 / 7.1) * 100"

To find the percentage increase, we can use the following formula:

Percentage Increase = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100

Percentage Increase = ((205 - 168) / 168) * 100
Percentage Increase = (37 / 168) * 100
Percentage Increase = 0.2206 * 100
Percentage Increase = 22.06%

So, the percentage rent increase between 2007 and 2008 was approximately 22.06%."

- 2016: $78 million
- 2015: $119 million
- 2014: $86 million

To find the percentage change from 2014 to 2015, we can use the formula:

((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100

Plugging in the values, we get:

((119 - 86) / 86) * 100
= (33 / 86) * 100

= 38.3%

So, the research and development costs increased by 38.3% from 2014 to 2015."

However, Document 9 also mentions the effective tax rate for 2014 as 24.0% on a GAAP basis.

Therefore, the lowest effective tax rate mentioned in the three-year period is 24.0% for 2014.

However, I noticed that Document 3 mentions the effective tax rate for 2016, which was lower than the statutory tax rate due to the release of valuation allowances.

Document 3 also mentions the effective tax rate for 2017, which was lower than the statutory tax rate due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities.

- Managed net interest income: $55,687 million

First, we'll calculate the ratio of CIB markets net interest income to managed net interest income:

$3,087 million / $55,687 million

This simplifies to:

0.0556

Now, we'll multiply this ratio by 100 to convert it to a percentage:

0.0556 * 100 = 5.56%

So, in 2018, the percent of the CIB markets net interest income as part of the managed interest income was 5.56%."

Document 7: The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 28, 2008, was $139.5 million, which is exclusive of interest and penalties.

We can see that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased from $110 million as of December 31, 2007, to $99 million as of December 31, 2008, as per Document 3.

However, we can also see that the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 28, 2008, was $139.5 million, which is exclusive of interest and penalties.

If we subtract the employee severance costs from the decrease in net income, we get:

From Document 1, we can find that the total square footage in Alpharetta, Georgia is 166,000 square feet. Since all facilities are leased, except for the office in Alpharetta, Georgia, all 166,000 square feet were not leased.

However, we also know that the square footage amounts are net of space that has been sublet or part of a facility restructuring. 

To find the total square footage in Alpharetta, Georgia before sublet or facility restructuring, we need more information. Unfortunately, it is not available in the provided documents.

However, from Document 6, we can see that the approximate total square footage in Alpharetta, Georgia is 254,000 square feet as of a certain date (which is likely later than December 2007).

So, the percent of the square footage in Alpharetta, Georgia that was not yet leased as of December 2007 is:

To find the percentage of total route miles that are main line in 2006, we can divide the main line route miles by the total route miles and multiply by 100:

However, the correct total assets for December 2012 are not mentioned in the document. But, according to Document 1, as of December 2013, total assets were $911.51 billion and as of December 2012, total assets were $938.56 billion (still not correct, so I re-read the document), which is actually an increase of $27.05 billion from December 2013. However, the document actually states that the total assets on our consolidated statements of financial condition were $ 938.56 billion, a decrease of $ 27.05 billion from December 2012. 

As of December 2013, total assets were $911.51 billion and as of December 2012, total assets were $938.56 billion. So the increase in total assets in 2012 is $27.05 billion, but the document actually states a decrease of $27.05 billion,"

This indicates that the company paid off $74.9 million of the ATI 7.25% (7.25%) notes during 2006.

To determine the portion of the notes that was paid off, we need to know the total outstanding amount of the ATI 7.25% (7.25%) notes as of December 31, 2005, which is $400.0 million (Document 2) or as of December 31, 2006, which is $325.1 million (Document 1).

We can use either of these amounts, but the question asks what portion was paid off ""during 2006"", so we can use the amount outstanding as of December 31, 2006, which is $325.1 million.

The portion of the notes that was paid off during 2006 is:

$74.9 million (repurchased) / $325.1 million (total outstanding) ≈ 23.1%

Original value: $736 million
New value: $708 million
Difference: $736 million - $708 million = $28 million

Percentage decline: ($28 million / $736 million) * 100 = 3.81%

So, the recorded international slot and route authorities declined by approximately 3.81% from $736 million to $708 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively."

In Document 6, there is a table that compares the 5-year cumulative total return of the 2018 peer group with other indices, including the S&P 500. Here is the relevant data for the 2018 peer group:

[""2018 peer group"", ""100.00"", ""127.40"", ""151.16"", ""177.26"", ""228.97"", ""286.22""]

We are interested in the percentage growth from 2016 to 2017. 

To find this, we can use the formula: ((new value - old value) / old value) * 100

Applying this formula, we get: ((177.26 - 151.16) / 151.16) * 100 ≈ 17.24%

Therefore, the percentage growth of the 5-year cumulative total return for the 2018 peer group from 2016 to 2017 is approximately 17.24%."

To find the ratio of the after-tax gains in 2004 compared to 2003, we can divide the 2004 gains by the 2003 gains.

(2004 gains) / (2003 gains) = $16,500,000 / $9,600,000 = 1.71 or 171%

This means that the after-tax gains in 2004 were 171% of the after-tax gains in 2003."

From Document 2, the revenue associated with agricultural products for 2015 is $3581 million.
