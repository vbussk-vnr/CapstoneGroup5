- US Airways: 21,000
- Wholly-owned regional carriers: 5,000
- Total: 121,000

To calculate the ratio of American personnel to US Airways personnel, you can divide the number of American personnel by the number of US Airways personnel:

95,000 (American) / 21,000 (US Airways) ≈ 4.52

So, the ratio of American personnel to US Airways personnel is approximately 4.52."

However, it does not provide the specific amount of intangible assets acquired.

However, Document 3 mentions that the company determined that only customer relationship, trade name, and developed technology and know-how had separately identifiable values. But it does not provide the total amount of intangible assets acquired.

Document 4 provides the amount of acquired amortizable intangible assets, which includes customer relationships of $54 million and trademarks of $69 million. But it does not provide the total amount of intangible assets acquired.

Since the total consideration for the acquisition of Anios was $798.3 million (Document 1), we can estimate the portion of total assets acquired that are intangible assets based on the information provided in Document 4.

Total acquired amortizable intangible assets = $54 million (customer relationships) + $69 million (trademarks) = $123 million

However, this only represents a portion of the total intangible assets acquired. Document 4 does not mention other intangible assets that may have been acquired as part of the Anios deal.

Assuming the ROI is calculated from March 31, 2007, to March 31, 2011, we can use the data from the graph to estimate the ROI.

From the graph, we can see that the cumulative total return of the Nasdaq Composite Index at the end of 2011 is approximately $175. This means that an investment of $100 at the beginning of the period (March 31, 2007) would be worth $175 at the end of the period (March 31, 2011).

To calculate the ROI, we can use the formula:
