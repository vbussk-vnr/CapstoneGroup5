From Document 1, we can see the total number of personnel for American and US Airways as follows:

American: 31600 (8600 + 15900 + 10800 + 8600 + 9100 + 8600)
US Airways: 32800

To find the ratio, we can divide the total number of American personnel by the total number of US Airways personnel:

Ratio = Total American personnel / Total US Airways personnel
= 31600 / 32800
= 0.964 (approximately)

Therefore, the ratio of the total American personnel to US Airways personnel is approximately 0.964 or 96.4%."

From Document 2, we know that 2015 net income increased $16.5 million primarily due to lower other operation and maintenance expenses, higher net revenues, and a lower effective income tax rate. This implies that net revenue increased.

From Document 7, we see that results of operations for 2015 include a deferred tax asset and resulting net increase in tax basis of approximately $334 million, which would affect net income, but not directly mentioned in the context of net revenue. However, we also see that results of operations for 2015 include the sale of the 583 MW Rhode Island State Energy Center for a realized gain of $154 million ($100 million net-of-tax), and the write-off and regulatory charges to recognize that a portion of the assets associated with the Waterford 3 Replacement Steam Generator Project is no longer probable of recovery, for a total of $77 million ($47 million net-of-tax). Additionally, we see that results of operations for 2015 include charges related to Vermont Yankee primarily resulting from the effects of an updated decommissioning cost study.

We will use the values for 2008 and 2007.

The difference between 2008 and 2007 is 31 - 44 = -13 (a decrease of 13)

The original value in 2007 is 44.

The percent change is then ( -13 / 44 ) * 100 = - 29.55%

So the aggregate net asset values of the direct lending collateral pools decreased by 29.55% between 2007 and 2008."

However, document 1 states that net revenues in investment management were $ 6.22 billion for 2017, 7% higher than 2016.

To answer the question, we should find the difference between 2017 and 2016. Since the net revenues in 2017 were $ 6.22 billion and the increase was 7%, we can calculate the net revenues in 2016.

Let's denote the net revenues in 2016 as x. The equation is: 
6.22 = x + (0.07 * x)
Combine like terms: 
6.22 = 1.07x
Now, divide both sides by 1.07: 
x = 6.22 / 1.07
x = 5.82

So, the net revenues in investment management were approximately $ 5.82 billion in 2016."

Then, we calculate the percentual decrease: ($18 / $260) * 100% ≈ -6.92%.

To find the percent, we can use the following formula:

In Document 1, the total assets value for 2013 is $911507 and for 2014 is $856240. 

To find the percentage in 2014, first, we need to find the difference between the two values and then divide that by the 2013 value.

Percentage decrease = ((911507 - 856240) / 911507) * 100

Percentage decrease = 6.14%

However, since we are looking for the percentage in total assets in 2014, we can directly use the percentage of the 2014 value over the base year's value which is 2013.

Percentage in 2014 = (856240 / 911507) * 100

Percentage in 2014 ≈ 93.77%

This represents an increase of $205.5 million in cash flows provided by operations between 2009 and 2010.

To find the percentage change, we can use the following formula:

Percentage change = (New value - Old value) / Old value x 100

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

Percentage change = ($205.5 million - $559.7 million) / $559.7 million x 100
= -$354.2 million / $559.7 million x 100

Document 3 states that the remaining unrecognized pre-tax compensation cost related to performance share awards at December 31, 2017 was approximately $6.8 million.

Assuming the compensation cost represents the amount put into the maximum performance pool, we can use the information in Document 1 to determine the amount put into the maximum performance pool between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2007.

However, we can see that the total value of securities borrowed is provided in Document 6, but it is not clear if this is the correct answer for the question.

Document 6 mentions that the total value of securities borrowed as of December 2015 and December 2014 is $ 69.80 billion and $ 66.77 billion, respectively. However, this value is not the total value of issuable long-term securities, as it is the fair value of securities borrowed, not securities that are yet to be issued.

Unfortunately, the context documents do not provide a clear answer to this question."
