financial statements 2014 ( continued ) we determine the discount rate used in the measurement of our obligations based on a model that matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date . when that timing does not correspond to a published high-quality bond rate , our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate . the yields on the bonds are used to derive a discount rate for the liability . the term of our obligation , based on the expected retirement dates of our workforce , is approximately eight years . in developing our expected rate of return assumption , we have evaluated the actual historical performance and long-term return projections of the plan assets , which give consideration to the asset mix and the anticipated timing of the plan outflows . we employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for what we consider a prudent level of risk . the intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run . risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities , plan funded status and our financial condition . the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments . furthermore , equity investments are diversified across u.s . and non-u.s . stocks as well as growth , value , and small and large capitalizations . derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner ; however , derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying investments . investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements , periodic asset and liability studies , and quarterly investment portfolio reviews .

% ) effective january 1 , 2014 . in addition , the revised capital framework will introduce a new tier 1 supplementary leverage ratio ( supplementary leverage ratio ) for advanced approach banking

assets less certain cet1 deductions plus certain off-balance-sheet exposures , including a measure of derivatives exposures and commitments . the revised capital framework requires a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3% ( 3 % ) , effective january 1 , 2018 , but with disclosure required beginning in the first quarter of 2015 . in addition , subsequent to the approval of the revised capital framework , the agencies issued a proposal to increase the minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement for the largest u.s . banks ( those deemed to be global systemically important

From Document 2:
We can see the number of personnel in different categories. However, we are not directly provided with the total personnel numbers. But, we can calculate the total personnel numbers for mainline operations and wholly-owned regional carriers.

Total mainline operations personnel: 101500 (pilots and flight crew training instructors) + 24700 (flight attendants) + 14900 (maintenance personnel) + 16600 (fleet service personnel) + 15900 (passenger service personnel) + 16000 (administrative and other) = 103400
Total wholly-owned regional carriers personnel: 20800 (pilots and flight crew training instructors) + 2200 (flight attendants) + 2000 (maintenance personnel) + 3500 (fleet service personnel) + 7100 (passenger service personnel) + 2600 (administrative and other) = 22400
Total American personnel (mainline and wholly-owned regional carriers): 103400 + 22400 = 125800

However, we are not provided with the personnel numbers for US Airways in the given documents.

Therefore, I must answer that the ratio
