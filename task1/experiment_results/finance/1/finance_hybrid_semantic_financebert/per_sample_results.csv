This document contains information about the total number of personnel in different categories.

Let's add up the total number of personnel in each category:

Mainline Operations: 101500
Wholly-Owned Regional Carriers: 20800
Total: 122300

We don't have any information about US Airways personnel in this document. However, if we assume that US Airways personnel are included in the wholly-owned regional carriers category, we can calculate the ratio as follows:

Total American personnel: 122300
US Airways personnel (assumed to be part of wholly-owned regional carriers): 20800

Ratio of total American personnel to US Airways personnel: 122300 / 20800 ≈ 5.88

Please note that this is an estimate, as we don't have any information about the exact number of US Airways personnel."
