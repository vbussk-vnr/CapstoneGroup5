finqa_6345,what is the rate of return in cadence design systems inc . of an investment from 2010 to 2011?,0.0425531914893617,0.0425531914893617,1.0,1.0,"According to Document 2, the rate of return in Cadence Design Systems Inc. from 2010 to 2011 can be calculated as follows:

- The initial investment in 2010 was $100.
- The value of the investment at the end of 2011 was $137.90.

To calculate the rate of return, we can use the formula:

Rate of Return = (Ending Value - Beginning Value) / Beginning Value
= ($137.90 - $100) / $100
= 0.378 or 37.8%

So, the rate of return in Cadence Design Systems Inc. from 2010 to 2011 was 37.8%."
finqa_7055,what is the ratio of the total american personnel to us airways personnel,0.004329004329004329,0.004329004329004329,1.0,1.0,"To find the ratio of the total American personnel to US Airways personnel, we first need to calculate the total personnel for each airline. We can do this by summing up the personnel in the columns for American, US Airways, and wholly-owned regional carriers in Document 1.

American: 8600 + 15900 + 10800 + 8600 + 9100 + 6100 + 8600 = 61600
US Airways: 4400 + 7700 + 3600 + 6200 + 6100 + 4800 + 32800 = 32800

We then calculate the ratio by dividing the total American personnel by the total US Airways personnel.

Ratio = 61600 / 32800 ≈ 1.88

So the ratio of the total American personnel to US Airways personnel is approximately 1.88."
finqa_6634,what portion of total assets acquired of anios are intangible assets?,0.10457516339869281,0.0196078431372549,0.1875,1.0,"To determine the portion of total assets acquired of Anios that are intangible assets, we need to look at Document 6 and Document 8.

Document 6 shows the total assets acquired and intangible assets separately. Total assets acquired are $473.6 million, and identifiable intangible assets are $252.0 million + $65.7 million + $16.1 million = $333.8 million.

Document 8 shows the total assets acquired and intangible assets separately. Total assets acquired are $2,217 million, and identifiable intangible assets are $1,800 million + $890 million + $215 million = $2,905 million. However, Document 8 is about a different acquisition and not Anios.

Since Document 6 is about Anios, we can calculate the portion of total assets acquired that are intangible assets as follows:

($333.8 million / $473.6 million) * 100% ≈ 70.5%

Therefore, approximately 70.5% of the total assets acquired of Anios are intangible assets."

The percent of the CIB markets net interest income as part of the managed interest income in 2018 can be calculated as follows:

cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 included a use of $ 250 million related to a change in accounting for our accounts receivable securitization program.

To answer the question, we need to subtract this amount from the cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010. However, we need to consider the adjusted cash flows provided by operating activities for the securitization facility, which is $ 4505 million (Document 1).

So, the cash flows provided by operating activities for all operations in 2010, without the charge for the A/R securitization, would have been $ 4505 million - $ 250 million = $ 4255 million.

However, considering the actual cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010, excluding the $ 250 million impact of additional accounts receivable from the change in accounting, cash flows provided by operations were $ 765.2 million (Document 2).

It appears that the question is asking to exclude the $ 250 million impact on accounts receivable from the change in accounting, but considering the data provided, we can only subtract the $ 250 million from the adjusted cash flows provided by operating activities.

Therefore, the correct answer is"

The cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities including discontinued operations in 2010 was $515.2 million and in 2009 was $559.7 million.

To find the percentage change, we can use the following formula:

Percentage change = ((New value - Old value) / Old value) × 100

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

((1.2 - 2.2) / 1.2) * 100

However, to find the total return of an investment of $100,000 in Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. from 12/11 to 12/16, we would need to know the initial price of the stock on 12/11 and the price of the stock on 12/16.

Unfortunately, the provided documents do not contain this information. However, we can calculate the total return for an investment of $100 from 12/11 to 12/16. Document 1 states that the graph tracks the performance of a $100 investment in Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. common stock and the S&P 500 index from 12/31/2011 to 12/31/2016.

To find the total return for an investment of $100,000, we would need to multiply the total return for an investment of $100 by 1000.

Percentage growth = ((177.26 - 151.16) / 151.16) * 100
= 17.35%

So, the percentage growth of the 5 year- cumulative total return for the 2018 peer group from 2016 to 2017 was 17.35%."

As of December 2013, the collateral posted was $18178 million, and as of December 2012, it was $24296 million.

To find the percentage change, we can use the following formula:

Percentage change = ((New value - Old value) / Old value) x 100

Plugging in the values, we get:

Percentage change = ((18178 - 24296) / 24296) x 100
= (-6108 / 24296) x 100
= -0.252 x 100
